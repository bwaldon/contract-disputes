MEMORANDUM\nPending before the Court are a motion for summary judgment (Doc. 36) filed by Plaintiffs Equitrans Services LLC and Equitrans Investments, LLC, trading as Equitrans, LP (collectively, “Equitrans”) and a' cross-motion for partial summary judgment (Doc. 40) filed by Defendant Precision Pipeline (“Precision”). For the reasons that follow, the parties’ motions will be granted in part and denied in part.\nBACKGROUND\n■ A. The Contract\nThis civil action arises from a contractual dispute concerning a pipeline construction project known as the “Sunrise Project” (hereafter, the “Project”). The Project involved the construction of approximately 45 miles of natural gas pipeline through Green County, Pennsylvania and Wetzel County, West Virginia. (DSMF at ¶1.).\nIn June 2011, the .parties entered into a contract relative to the Project (hereafter, the “Contract”), pursuant to which Equi-trans agreed to pay Precision an estimated base contract price of $75,358,176.54 for its construction of the pipeline. (See Compl. at ¶ 9, Doc. 1-2; Notice of Removal at ¶ 1, Doc. 1.) The Contract was comprised of a Master Construction Services Agreement (“MSA”), the Sunrise Project Pipeline Construction Specification (“Project Specifications”), the EQT Pipeline Construction Standard, alignment sheets, and erosion and sedimentation control plans, all of which Precision was required to follow during construction. (DSMF at ¶ 13; Def.’s Ex. 8-19 (Doc. 43-8), Ex. 8-25 (Doc. 43-10), Ex. 8-22 (Doc. 43-9), Ex. 8-58 (Doc. 43-12), and 8-60 (Doc. 43-13).)\nThe dispute in this case centers primarily on the meaning and application of certain warranty and indemnification provisions in the Contract. One key warranty provision is Section 8.1 óf the MSÁ, entitled “Warranty of Work,” which states:\nContractor warrants its Work against all deficiencies and' defects in materials and/or workmanship and as required for [sic] in the Contract Documents, Contractor shall guaranty or warrant its Work for a period of one (1) year from the date of substantial completion of its Work.\n(Def.’s Ex. 8-19, Doc. 43-8.) Another key warranty provision is Article 64 of the Project Specifications, wherein Precision warranted its earthwork as follows:\nContractor shall warrant all earthwork for a period of fifteen (15) months after the retention has been accepted. Earth work shall cover all trench subsidence, any slips or slides and excessive erosion attributable to the improper installation of erosion control devices. ... Contractor agrees to remobilize to repair any earthwork or piping defect within fourteen (14) calendar days after receiving written notification that a project defect is attributable to the Contractor’s workmanship or materials.\n(Def.’s Ex. 8-25, p. 52, Doc. 43-10 (emphasis in the original).) Of potential relevance to these warranty obligations is Section ,9.7 of the MSA, “Quality of Work,” which states:\nContractor will comply with the Contract Documents as they may be modified, will complete the Work in a good and workmanlike manner free from defects and will use the skill and judgment customarily utilized in the trade of Contractor in performing the Work. The Work will at all times meet the approval of the Company. Contractor will inspect all surfaces prior to commencing work. Contractor will not commence work until deficiencies and other surface/subsurface conditions that would adversely affect the integrity of Contractor’s completed Work have been corrected. Contractor shall inform Company immediately should any surface/subsurface be- unacceptable to commence or continue the Work. Contractor’s start of the Work ■constitutes\"" Contractor’s acceptance of the existing surfaces and conditions.\n(Def.’s Ex. 8-19, Doc. 43-8.)\nPrecision also assumed the following indemnity obligations pursuant to Section 12.1 of the MSA:\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, Contractor shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless [Equitrans], its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, co-owners, co-lessees and their partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns (“Indemnitees”) from and against any and, all claims, demands, causes of action, damages, liabilities, judgments, losses, fines, awards, penalties, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and other costs of defense (hereinafter “Claims and Expenses”) arising out of or resulting from Contractor’s Work or other performance under this agreement and/or attributable to: (a) the negligent or willful act or omission of Contractor, its subcontractors, suppliers, employees, agents or invitees, or anyone acting under Contractor’s direction or control in connection with the performance of the Work or for whose acts Contractor may be liable, or anyone acting under contractor’s direction or control in connection with the perform-anee of the Work or for whose acts Contractor may be liable; (b) breach by Contractor of any representation or warranty of Contractor; (c) Contractor’s failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement or the Contract Documents; (d) if Contractor transports or hauls Company property (including loading and unloading), any resulting damage or loss; or (e) contractor’s failure to comply with Applicable Laws, Safety Rules, or Permits (defined below), including without limitation any corrective measures which may be required.\n(Defi’s Ex. 8-19, Doc. 43-8.)\nB. The Slope Failures\nIt is undisputed that, following the completion of construction, twenty-nine (29) slides occurred along parts of the right-of-way that Equitrans had obtained for construction of the pipeline. (DSMF at ¶ 19.) Equitrans notified Precision of these occurrences and demanded that the slides be repaired. (PSMF at ¶¶43, 45.) Precision repaired some of the slides, but, as to certain others, Precision offered to make repairs only on a time and materials basis. (PSMF at ¶¶ 46-47.) Equitrans understood that it was contractually obligated to restore each landowner’s property along the right-of-way, so it repaired those landslides that Precision did not repair. (Id. at ¶¶ 40, 48.) Equitrans states that it incurred $6,743,851.14 in damages for repairing slips and slides on the Project. (PSMF at ¶ 85.)\nC. The Road Work\nEquitrans alleges that it provided road bonds to municipalities and local government agencies in order for Precision to utilize certain public roads in connection with its work. (Compl. at ¶ 19, Doc. 1-2.) According to Equitrans, PennDOT and the municipalities demanded that the roads be restored to their pre-construction condition before Equitrans would be released from its road bonds. (Id. at ¶¶ 23-24.)\nPursuant to the EQT Pipeline Construction Standard — an element of the parties’ Contract, Precision agreed that: “Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining and repairing existing roads such that the condition of the road after construction equals the condition of the road prior to construction.” (PSMF at ¶ 79; Pl.s’ Ex. 0 at p. 2121, § 2.2, bullet point 4, Doc. 39-8.) In accordance with the Project Specifications, Precision was required to produce both a pre-construction video of the access roads it would utilize on the Project, capturing their pre-existing conditions, and a post-construction video documenting the as-left condition of the right of way, ancillary sites and access roads restored by Precision. (PSMF at ¶¶ 60-61; Pi’s Ex. M at §§ 19 and 56, Doc. 39-8.)\nPrecision viewed its obligation under these provisions as requiring it to pay for any road damage that it had caused, but not requiring it to pay for road damage caused by others. (PSMF at ¶ 74.) After paying over $1,000,000 toward road repairs, Precision advised Equitrans that it believed these payments had fulfilled its contractual obligations. (Id. at ¶¶ 75-76.) Thereafter, Equitrans paid ■ some $1,292,025.90 in additional road repair costs. (PSMF at ¶ 88.)\nD.The Settlement\nIn June 2013, Equitrans and Precisión entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release'(“Settlement Agreement”) in an attempt to resolve certain claims related to Precision’s work on the Project. (DSMF at ¶44.) Under Paragraph 6 of the Settlement Agreement, Equitrans agreed to “waive[ ] any and all claims to any backc-harges that it has asserted or could assert against Precision concerning the Project for work completed prior to the date of this Agreement.” (Def.’s Ex. 8-97 at ¶6, Doc. 43-28.) Paragraph 8 of the Settlement Agreement also contained a broad mutual release clause covering “all claims, counterclaims, rights, demands, costs (including attorney’s fees), \""damages, losses, liabilities, actions and causes of action of every nature and description whether known or unknown...” that either party might have as of the date of the Settlement Agreement. (Id. at ¶8). Notwithstanding this broad release, Equitrans expressly \""reserved its right “to assert any and all claims that it has or\"" may have in the future against Precision for latent defect and/or warranty and/or indemnity items.” (Id.) Precision likewise “reserve[d] all rights to dispute any claims by [Equitrans] related to latent defects and/or warranty and/or indemnity items.” (Id.)\nE. This Lawsuit.\nEquitrans commenced this lawsuit on November 13, 2013, by filing its complaint in the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas. (See Notice of Removal at ¶ 2, Doc. 1.) Thereafter, the case was removed to this Court. (See Doc. 1.)\n■The complaints sets \""forth three causes of action sounding in: breach of contract (Count I); breach of warranty (Count II); and breach of indemnity obligations (Count III). (See Docs. 1-2.) These counts are all based on Equitrans’s assertion that Precision breached its obligations- under the contract by failing to remedy slope failures, failing to repair damaged roads, and failing to indemnify Equitrans for the costs it incurred in securing necessary repairs. Equitrans . maintains that it is entitled to summary judgment on- all three counts of the Complaint pursuant to the clear and unambiguous language in the Contract.\nPrecision argues that Equitrans’s claims for breach of contract and breach of warranty fail because (1) Precision only warranted against defects in its materials or workmanship arid (2) as to all but two of the slides, Equitrans has failed to present evidence sufficient to show\"" that Precision’s defective materials or workmanship (as opposed to Equitrans’s defective design) caused the slides. As to Equitrans’s indemnity claim, Precision argues that’the language of the indemnity clause expressly limits Equitrans to recovering its losses on third-party claims and such losses have not been demonstrated. Precisión further argues that certain \""of Equitrans’s alleged damages Were waived by the June 2013 Settlement Agreement.\nANALYSIS\nAt the heart of this case lies a dispute about the parties’ respective rights and obligations under the Contract. Under Pennsylvania, law, “‘[t]he fundamental rule in interpreting the meaning of a contract is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the contracting parties.’ ” Indian Harbor Ins. Co. v. F & M Equip., Ltd., 804 F.3d 310, 313 (3d Cir.2015) (quoting Murphy v. Duquesne Univ., 565 Pa. 571, 777 A.2d 418, 429 (2001)). The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has summarized the “well established” “division of labor between court and fact-finder when interpreting a contract”:\nFirst, we must determine (as a matter of law) whether contractual language is ambiguous....Hutchison v. Sunbeam Coal Corp., 513 Pa. 192, 519 A.2d 385, 390 (1986). If we determine that the language is unambiguous, we- follow its plain meaning. If, however, we conclude that the language is ambiguous, we leave it to a fact-finder to decide its meaning. See Ins. Adjustment Bureau, Inc. v. Allstate Ins., Inc., 588 Pa. 470, 905 A.2d 462, 469 (2006)....\nPac. Employers Ins. Co. v. Glob. Reinsurance Corp. of Am., 693 F.3d 417, 426 (3d Cir.2012) (interpreting Pennsylvania and New York law; references to New York law omitted).\nOf some relevance here is the fact that the parties’ Contract contains an integration clause. (See MSA at § 19.9, Def.’s Ex. 8-19, Doe. 43-8.) Where the parties have entered into an agreement that represents the parties’ “entire contract” or an integrated contract, parole or extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to explain or vary the terms of the agreement; however, such evidence is admissible for the purpose of resolving an ambiguity in the contract. See U.S. ex rel. Greenmoor, Inc. v. Travelers Cas. & Sur. Co. of Am., No. CIV. A. 06-CV-0234, 2009 WL 4730233, at *44 (W.D.Pa. Dec. 4, 2009) (citing Yocca v. Pittsburgh Steelers Sports, Inc., 578 Pa. 479, 854 A.2d 425, 436 (2004) (stating that “parole evidence is admissible to explain or clarify or resolve th¿ ambiguity, irrespective of whether the ambiguity is created by the language of the instrument or- by extrinsic or collateral circumstances”)). “Thus, while a court must interpret an unambiguous contract ‘according to the natural meaning of its terms,’ a court may ‘look outside the four corners of a contract’ when interpreting an ambiguous contract.” Id. (quoting Bohler-Uddeholm America, Inc. v. Ellwood Group, Inc., 247 F.3d 79, 93 (3d Cir.2001)).\nA contract is ambiguous if it “ ‘is reasonably or fairly susceptible of different constructions and is capable of being'understood in more senses than one and is obscure in meaning through indefiniteness of expression or has a double meaning.’ ” U.S. ex rel. Greenmoor, Inc., 2009 WL 4730233, at *45 (quoting Bohler-Uddeholm America, Inc., 247 F.3d at 93). In determining whether an ambiguity exists, a “‘court may consider the words of- the contract, the, alternative meaning suggested.by counsel, and the nature,of the objective evidence to. be offered in support of that meaning.’ ” Id. (quoting Bohler-Uddeholm America, Inc., 247 F.3d at 93). “An ambiguity can be either patent, i.e., on the face of the contract,, or latent.” Id. A latent ambiguity “.‘arises from extraneous or collateral facts which make the meaning of a written agreement uncertain although the language thereof, on its face, appears clear and unambiguous.’” Id. (quoting Bohler-Uddeholm America, Inc., 247 F.3d at 93)). “Thus, a latent ambiguity, must be based on a ‘contractual hook’ in that the extrinsic evidence ‘must support an alternative meaning of a specific term or terms contained in the contract, rather than simply support a general'claim that the parties meant something other than what the contract says on its face.’ ” Id. (quoting Bohler-Uddeholm America, Inc., 247 F.3d at 96).\nA. Equitrans’s Breach of .Contract Claims (Count I)\nFor purposes of its summary judgment motion, Equitrans defines its breach of contract claim in terms of five separate breaches — namely, Precision’s: (1) failure to comply with its warranty obligations; (2) refusal-to indemnify Equitrans for losses arising out of Precision’s work; (3) commencement of work «despite having failed to familiarize itself with the conditions affecting construction; (4) representation to Equitrans, by commencing and proceeding with the work, that it “accepted” the surface and subsurface conditions as is; and (5) failure to restore roads bonded by Equitrans for Precision’s use. (Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. at ¶ 26, Doc. 36.) Items (1) and (2) are essentially redundant of the breach of warranty and indemnity claims at Counts II and III of the complaint and will be addressed in connection with those claims.\nItems (3) and (4) are based on Equi-trans’s interpretations of Sections 9.3 and 9.7 of the MSA and portions of Precision’s April 8, 2011, proposal for the Project (PL’s Ex. P, Doc. 39-9.) According to Equi-trans, these various provisions set forth Precision’s “clear and undisputed duties under the Contract” (PL’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. at 6, Doc. 37), whereby Precision:\n• agreed that its “start of the Work constitute^] its acceptance of the existing surfaces and conditions” (MSA at § 9.7);\n• promised to “inspect all surfaces prior to commencing work” (MSA at § 9.7);\n• represented that it had “familiarized itself with: (A) The conditions affect ing construction at the Project site where the Work is to be performed” (MSA at §9.3);\n• acknowledged it had “thoroughly reviewed [Equitrans’ Requests for Quote]... and the general and local conditions particularly those bearing upon: transportation, disposal, handling and storage of materials; availability of roads, the topography and conditions on the ground;... and all other matters upon which information is reasonably obtainable and which can in any way affect the work or the cost thereof under the RFQ.... All dimensions shall be field checked by [Precision]. Any failure by [Precision] to acquaint themselves with all the available information will not relieve [Precision] from responsibility for estimating properly the difficulty or cost to successfully perform the work...” (Precision’s proposal for the Project, Doc. 39-9 at p. 20);\n• affirmed it would “not commence work until deficiencies and other surface/subsurface conditions that would adversely affect the integrity of [its] completed Work have been corrected” (MSA at § 9.7); and\n• promised to “inform [Equitrans] immediately should any surface/subsurface be unacceptable to commence or continue the work” (MSA at § 9.7).\n(See PL’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. at 6-7, Doc. 37.) Equitrans posits that, by virtue of these contractual representations, Precision assumed total responsibility for the ground surface and subsurface conditions where it performed its work. Specifically,\n[i]f there was a deficiency or other surface/subsurface condition which would affect the integrity of its Work, Precision was to bring it to Equitrans’ attention. At that point, the deficiency or other surface/subsurface condition which would affect the integrity of Precision’s completed Work would be corrected. Once Precision started its Work, it represented to Equitrans its acceptance of the existing surfaces and subsurface conditions of the Project site/route.\n(PL’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. at 7, Doc. 37.)\nPreliminarily, the Court concludes that, although these provisions may have relevance in the context of Equitrans’s breach of warranty claim, they cannot form the basis of an independent breach of contract claim, because the parties’ June 2013 Settlement Agreement effectuated a release of Equitrans’s then-existing claims, other than its claims for breach of warranty and indemnity obligations. At the time the parties entered into the Settlement Agreement, there were a number of outstanding disputes between, them relative to Precision’s work on the Project. Specifically, Equitrans was holding $9,344,733.00. in re-tainage from Precision. (See Def.’s Ex. 8-97, Doc. 43-28.) Precision had submitted numerous “requests for information” (RFIs) in which it sought additional compensation for work that Precision considered to be outside the scope of work called for by the Contract. (Id.) Certain of Precision’s RFIs had been approved by Equi-trans and others had been rejected; (Id.) In addition, Precision had filed claims for mechanic’s liens against Equitrans in Greene County, Pennsylvania and Wetzel County, West Virginia. (Id.) In order “to put to rest all further controversy, to compromise their claims and differences...', and to effect the release of all claims which have been, or might have been, asserted by or against each of them,” (id.), the parties entered into the Settlement Agreement. The agreement’s “recitals” expressly acknowledge the parties’ intent “to release any and all claims each may have against any Party relating in any way to the Project and the Contract with the exception of warranty claims and indemnity claims...” (Id.) To that end, the agreement contains a broad release clause, applicable to “any and all claims. . ..and causes of action of every nature and description whether known or, unknown., .[that the. parties] have or may have from the beginning of time up to and including the date [of the Settlement Agreement], relating' in any way to the Contract, the Pennsylvania Lien, the West Virginia Lien, the Project and/or the Dispute, with the exception of the warranty and indemnity claims...” (Id; at 1i 8)\nBased on the unambiguous language of the Settlement Agreement, it is clear that the parties intended to release any breach of contract claims, other than those for alleged breaches of warranty or indemnity obligations, that existed as of the date of the Settlement Agreement. Accordingly, judgment for Precision is appropriate to the extent Equitrans is asserting non-warranty , breach of contract claims based on: (a) Precision’s failure to familiarize itself with the conditions affecting construction prior .to commencing its work and/or (b) Precision’s “representation” to Equitrans, by commencing and proceeding with the .work, that it “accepted” the surface and subsurface conditions of the Project site.\nEquitrans also bases its breach of contract claim on Precision’s failure to restore roads that were bonded by Equitrans for Precision’s use. Precision argues that certain aspects of Equitrans’s damages claim in this regard are barred by the June 2013 Settlement Agreement. In particular, Precision challenges Equitrans’s requests for damages relative to, among other things, road repair work that was completed and invoiced by Pennoni & Associates, Inc. (“Peiinoni”) prior to the date of the Settlement Agreement. As the Court discusses in more ‘ detail below in connection with Equitrans’s indemnity claim, it is not clear from the present state of the record the extent to which these “Pennoni Claims” form the basis of Equitrans’s third-party indemnity claims, which presumably were not waived by the Settlement Agreement. Consequently, to the extent Precision is moving for summary judgment relative to any breach of contract claims premised on payments made by Equitrans for road repairs, existing issues of material fact render- summary judgment inappropriate.\nB. Equitrans’s Warranty Claims (Count II)\nFollowing the completion of the* pipeline’s construction, twenty-nine (29) slides occurred along parts of the right-of-way that Equitrans had obtained for purposes of the construction. (DSMF at ¶ 19.) In Count II of the Complaint, Equitrans alleged that Precision has “breached its warranty obligations by failing to repair the slope failures when notified of the same.... ” (Compl. at ¶ 40.)\nEquitrans’s breach of warranty claim is based on MSA Section 8.1 and Article 64 of the Project Specifications. With regard to MSA Section 8.1, Equitrans interprets this provision as encompassing two separate warranties. The first sentence states that “Contractor warrants its Work against all deficiencies, and defects in materials and/or workmanship, and as required for [sic], in the Contract Documents.” (MSA at § 8.1, Def.’s Ex. 8-19, Doc. 43-8.) Equitrans interprets this sentence as a promise by Precision that the.re will not be any defects or deficiencies in its workmanship or its materials, without any reference to a time limitation. The second sentence of Section 8.1 states that “Contractor shall guaranty or warrant its Work for a period of one (1) year from the date of. substantial. completion, of its Work.” (Id.) Equitrans interprets this sentence as a separate, “bumper-to-bumper” guarantee and warranty of Precision’s “work” that lasts for one year but is not limited to whether a slide or other defect was caused by defective workmanship or materials. Equitrans maintains that any slope failure and/or slip or slide is a deficiency in Precision’s “work” and, since all of the slides at issue occurred within the one-year time period following completion of its work, Equitrans reasons that all of the slides are covered by the “second warranty” in Section 8.1.\nArticle 64 of the Specifications states that the “Contractor shall warrant all earthwork for a period of fifteen (15) months after the retention has been accepted,” and “[ejarthwork shall cover all trench subsidence, any slips or slides and excessive erosion attributable to the improper installation of erosion control devices.” (Project Specification Art. 64, Def.’s Ex. 8-25, Doc. 43-10.) Equitrans maintains that, under the plain language of Article 64, “any” slip or slide constitutes a breach of Precision’s earthwork warranty; thus, by refusing to repair the slope failures that occurred within the warranty time frame, Precision breached its warranties.\nBy contrast, Precision maintains that the warranty provisions in question apply only to defects in its workmanship and materials. Precision concedes that there are issues of fact as to whether defects in its workmanship were responsible for two of the “slides” at issue — namely, the Watson West slide at Milepost 8.57-8,64 (“Watson West”) and the Marisa sinkhole at Milepost 10.13 (the “Marisa Sinkhole”). Accordingly, it does not seek summary judgment relative to these two “slides.”\nAs for the other twenty-seven (27) slope failures, however,'Precision maintains that there is no evidence to establish that these slides resulted from defects in its workmanship or materials. Precision contends that Equitrans has failed to proffer any expert testimony concerning the cause for the slope failures with respect to ten (10) of the slides — i.e., those numbered “20 through (29)” in Precision’s Exhibit 9 (Doc. 43-31) and pertaining to the Shultz, Mar-ling, Ankrom, Raymont, Tennant, Minor, Efaw, and Fairbanks properties as well as Mileposts 0.26-0.53 and 0.33 at Underwood property. With respect to the remaining seventeen (17) slides — denoted as numbers 1,2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17, 18 and 19 in Precision’s Ex. 9 (Doc. 43-31) (hereafter, the “Disputed Slides”), the parties have presented competing theories as to the root causes of these slope failures, but Precision contends that neither theory can support a finding of liability on its part.\nIn his expert report submitted on behalf of Precision, Steven Pasternack, P.E., Ph. D., opines that the slope failures were caused by: (a) the pipeline being routed on overly steep slopes and (b) the rights-of-way being located over old landslides, active landslides, or soil and rock susceptible to landslides. (PL’s Ex. I, Doc. 39-5.) Precision maintains that, under the terms of the Contract, it was not responsible for these conditions. On the other hand, Equitrans’s expert witness, Jon D. Raab, P.E., opined that the slope failures were attributable to Precision’s workmanship, including its selection of inadequate means and methods to reconstruct stable slopes and its failure in some cases to use engineered stability measures. (Def.’s Ex. 8-67, Doc. 43-15.) Precision interprets Mr. Raab’s report and testimony as establishing that, with regard to each of the 17 Disputed Slides, the slopes required additional engineered stability measures because, they were steeper than a ratio of 2H:1V. Precision insists that it had no responsibility under the Contract for such measures and that all engineering and design responsibility for slide mitigation measures rested with Equitrans. Accordingly, Precision maintains that the record cannot support a finding of any warranty.liability on its part relative to. the seventeen Disputed Slides.\nPrecision’s interpretation of MSA Section 8.1 and Article 64 as warranting only against defects in workmanship, and materials holds some appeal. This Court is inclined .to agree. that the .- more logical interpretation of Section 8.1 is that the first sentence merely describes, the breadth or scope of the warranty (i.e., a warranty against defects in materials and workmanship), while the second sentence describes its length (i.e., one year from substantial completion). To interpret the second sentence as a distinct, stand-alone warranty whereby Precision broadly guaranteed or warranted its work would render the first sentence’s warranty against- defects in workmanship superfluous. This would violate the fundamental principle of contract interpretation that every phrase of a contract should be given meaning and none should be treated as surplusage if any other construction of the contract is rationally possible. See Riverside Sch. Dist. v. Career Tech. Ctr., 104 A.3d 73, 76 (Pa.Commw.Ct.2014) (citation omitted). To avoid this problem and give meaning to both clauses, Equitrans suggests that the “second, warranty” (i.e., the bumper-to-bumper unconditional guarantee of Precision’s work) lasts only one yeap, whereas the “first warranty” relating to workmanship does not reference any time limit. However, it seems unlikely that the parties, having assigned a particular time limit to one warranty, would fail to assign a time limit to the other. Nor does it seem likely that Precision intended to provide an interminable warranty relative to its workmanship.\nPrecision’s proposed interpretation' of MSA Section 8.1 is buttressed by the language in Article 64, which similarly appears to restrict Precision’s earthwork warranty to issues of defective workmanship. Equitrans’s assertion that Article 64 obligates Precision to repair “any slips or slides” irrespective of them cause ignores the last sentence of the provision, whereby Precision “agree[d] to remobilize to repair any earthwork or piping defect within fourteen (14) calendar days after receiving written notification that a project defect is attributable to the Contractor’s workmanship or materials.” (Project Specification Art. 64, Def.’s Ex. 8-25, Doc. 43-10 (italicized emphasis supplied).) Equi-trans’s interpretation of Article 64 appears to ignore this express contractual provision, which cannot be written out of the contract or disregarded by the Court. See Neuhard v. Range Resources-Appalachia, LLC, 29 F.Supp.3d 461, 474 (M.D.Pa.2014). Nor does it seem likely that the parties intended to create two separate earthwork warranties whereby Precision would remobilize for repairs within 14 days for cases involving defective workmanship, but would be under no particular time constraints with respect to non-workmanship-related repairs.\nThus, the Court is inclined to agree with Precision that MSA Section 8.1 and Article 64 of the Specifications imply warranties related to workmanship, as opposed to an absolute warranty against slope failures irrespective of their cause. Nevertheless, even if the Court accepts Precision’s interpretation of the warranty provisions as limiting its liability to defects in workmanship, this does not entirely end the matter, because the Court must consider what Precision’s contractual “workmanship” responsibilities entailed. Fundamentally, the parties disagree concerning the extent to which the Contract imposed responsibility on Precision for ensuring adequate earthwork stabilization measures.\nAs to this issue, the Court perceives an ambiguity in the Contract which cannot be resolved as a matter of law at the summary judgment stage. Precision maintains that its only responsibilities under the Contract were to construct what Equitrans designed. To support its position, Precision points to the testimony of Equitrans’s project manager and Equitrans’s filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as evidence that Equitrans was responsible to design any necessary slide mitigation measures but failed to incorporate such measures into its design. Precision also interprets Mr. Raab’s report and testimony as establishing that, with regard to each of the 17 Disputed Slides, the terrain required additional engineered stability measures beyond those that were incorporated into Equitrans’s design. Precision insists that it cannot be held contractually liable for any defects in Equi-trans’s design, since it was obligated to adhere to that design.\nOn the other hand, Equitrans has produced some evidence supportive of its position that Precision assumed contractual responsibility relative to earthwork mitigation measures. As previously discussed, Section 9.7 of the MSA, entitled “Quality of Work,” ostensibly obligated Precision to inspect all surfaces prior to commencing its work, immediately inform Equi-trans of any “unacceptable” surface or subsurface conditions, and refrain from commencing work “until deficiencies and other surface/subsurfaee conditions that would adversely affect the integrity of Contractor’s completed work have been corrected.” (Id.) Under the terms of this provision, the “Contractor’s start of the Work constitute[d] . Contractor’s acceptance of the existing surfaces and conditions.” (Id.) Similarly, under Section 9.3 of the MSA, Precision represented that it had familiarized itself with, and accepted, conditions affecting construction at the project site where its work was to be performed. In addition, Section, 9.9 of the MSA required Precision to give Equitrans “prompt written, notice” of any “Company Furnished Property” — including any specifications, drawings, designs, schematics, and technical information — that Precision found to be defective. (MSA at § 9.9(F).) Collectively, these provisions provide some evidence that the parties intended Precision to bear the responsibility of identifying and addressing inherently unfavorable surface or subsurface conditions that might affect the integrity of its work so that enhanced stability measures could be employed. In addition, Article 45 of the Project Specifications addresses Precision’s- responsibility to recontour the project areas to their original condition and, to that end, it recognizes that “[stabilization of disturbed slopes may require the Contractor to determine and install sufficient mitigation.. .to guarantee that slips will not occur.” (Def.’s Ex. 8-25, Doc. 43-10.)\nPrecision argues that, under the “Spearin doctrine,” Equitrans’s impliedly warranted the suitability of its design specifications, and Equitrans cannot rely on “boilerplate” contractual provisions to shift responsibility to Precision for defects in Equitrans’s-design. See United States v. Spearin, 248 U.S. 132, 136-137, 39 S.Ct. 59, 63 L.Ed. 166 (1918) (“[I]f the contractor is bound to build according to plans and specifications prepared by the owner, the contractor will not be responsible for the consequences of defects in the plans and specifications.”); E. Elec. Corp. of New Jersey v. Shoemaker Const. Co., 657 F.Supp.2d 545, 558-59 (E.D.Pa.2009) (“According to Pennsylvania law, an owner impliedly warrants the accuracy and completeness of the plans and specifications that it furnishes to the Contract.”) (citing Rhone Poulenc Rorer Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Newman Glass Works, 112 F.3d 695 (3d Cir.1997)). Thus, a contractor is generally not liable for simply performing work in accordance with owner-issued design specifications. See A.G. Cullen Construction, Inc. v. State System of Higher Education, 898 A.2d 1145, 1156-57 (Pa. Commw.Ct.2006).\nHowever, this doctrine . only applies where the contractor relies oh the owners design specifications. Design specifications “describe in precise detail the materials to be employed and the manner in which the work is to be performed. The contractor has no discretion to deviate from the'specifications, but is required to follow them as one would a road map.” A.G. Cullen, 898 A.2d at 1156. In contrast, performance specifications “set forth an objective or standard to be achieved, and the successful bidder is expected to exercise his ingenuity in achieving that objective' or standard of performance, selecting the means and assuming a corresponding responsibility for' that selection.” Id.; see also Aquatrol Corp. v. Altoona City Auth., 296 Fed.Appx. 221, 224 (3d Cir.2008).\nHere, Equitrans argues that it did not- provide any design specifications that specifically related to earthwork. Equi-trans further contends that the construction “typicals” it provided in its FERC filings were in the nature of performance specifications and that Precision exercised substantial discretion in performing the earthwork. As noted, Article 45 of the Project Specifications addresses Precision’s responsibility- to recontour the project areas to their-original condition and, to that end, it recognizes that “[stabilization of disturbed slopes may require the Contractor to determine and install sufficient mitigation.. .to guarantee that slips will-not-occur.” (Def.’s Ex. 8-25, Doc. 43-10.) Although Precision has provided fairly compelling evidence that it lacked any design responsibilities relative to the Project, the Court concludes that Equitrans has proffered at least enough evidence to demonstrate an ambiguity in the .contract concerning the scope of Precision’s workmanship responsibilities as it pertains to slide mitigation measures. As previously noted, where a contractual ambiguity exists, the fact-finder must determine its meaning. Pac. Employers Ins. Co., 693 F.3d at 426.\nIn addition, the Court concludes that factual issues as to the cause of certain slope failures cannot be resolved as a matter of law at the summary judgment stage. Although Precision claims that Mr. Raab testified unequivocally that the lack of additional engineered stability measures were the .ultimate cause of the slope failures at the seventeen Disputed Slides, the Court does not interpret ,Mr. Raab’s testimony as completely unequivocal in this regard, in actuality, Mr. Raab opined that such measures were “likely” required for areas exceeding a 2H:1V slope, but this was not a “definitive threshold,” and the need for additional measures would entail an individualized inquiry on a “case-by-case basis” depending on the degree to which a slope exceeded a 2H:1V ratio. (Raab Dep. at 99-102, Doc. 43-5.) Based on information obtained from Equitrans’s project manager and the language of the Contract documents,- Mr. Raab agreed that Precision assumed design responsibilities with regard to earthwork and recontouring (see Raab Report at 3-6, Doc. 43-15; Raab Dep. at 69, Doc. 50-5), and he opined that numerous workmanship issues caused or influence the 'instability at the Disputed Slides, including (among other things): the quality of the fill used at the various slide sites, the'placement of additional fill’over steep natural slopes, the placement of fill on steep slopes without appropriate benching, and inadequate control of groundwater and seepage. To the extent Mr.- Raab’s testimony contains internal inconsistencies or is contradicted by-other evidence of record,- these -are matters for the fact-finder to assess in determining-his credibility. Given the disputed expert-opinion evidence concerning the cause of the seventeen Disputed Slides, -the ambiguities in the Contract concerning Precision’s -responsibilities relative to earthwork mitigation design, and the highly technical nature of these inquiries; the Court is not in a position to resolve the pending cross-motions based on the current state of the record. Accordingly, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment will be denied relative to Count II of the Complaint insofar those motions relate to the seventeen Disputed Slides, the Watson West Slide, and the Marisa Sinkhole.\nThat having been said, the Court agrees with Precision that it is entitled to judgment relative to the remaining ten (10). slides designated as numbers “20 through (29)” in Precision’s Exhibit 9 (Doc. 43-31) that occurred at the Shultz, Mar-ling, Ankrom, Raymont, Tennant, Minor, Efaw, and Fairbanks properties as well as Mileposts 0.26-0.53 and 0.33 at Underwood property. The Court agrees that the cause of these slope failures is a matter involving specialized or technical knowledge as to which expert testimony is required. Because Equitrans failed to proffer any expert opinion as to the cause of these slides, and because the existing evidence of record is otherwise insufficient as a matter of law to establish that the-cause of these slides was attributable to defects in Precision’s workmanship, Precision is entitled to judgment on Count II insofar the warranty claim is premised on these particular slope failures.\nC. Plaintiffs Indemnity Claims (Count HI)\nIn Count III of the Complaint, Equi-trans asserts a claim for breach of Precision’s indemnity obligations arising out of its failure to indemnify Equitrans for certain repairs. (Compl. at ¶40.) In moving for summary judgment on this claim, Equitrans notes that, under Section 12.1 of the MSA, Precision is obligated to indemnify Equitrans for any “damages,.. .losses,. . .costs and expenses” arising out of Precision’s “Work or other performance under [the MSA] and/or attributable to... “breach by Contractor of any representation or warranty” or “Contractor’s failure to comply with any provision of [the MSA] or. the Contract Documents.”. (MSA at § 12.1, Def.’s Ex. 8-19, Doc. No. 43.-8.) Equitrans argues that, due to Precision’s breach of its contractual obligation to perform slope repairs along the pipeline right-of-way, Equitrans incurred costs .in securing the repairs itself. Consequently, Equi-trans argues that it incurred “damages, losses, costs and expenses” due to Precision’s “work” or other performance under the contract,- entitling Equitrans to recover all “damages, losses, costs and expenses” (including attorney fees) resulting from the breach of Precision’s indemnity obligations.\nPrecision maintains that the language of the MSA’s indemnification clause clearly limits Precision’s obligations to situations involving third-party claims. The undersigned finds- this argument persuasive for a number of reasons.\nFirst, Section 12.1 expressly requires Precision to “defend, indemnify, and hold [Equitrans] harmless” , from and against “any claims, .demands, causes of action, damages, • liabilities, judgments, losses, fines, awards, penalties, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and other costs of defense...” Courts in this circuit have recognized that the terms “defend, indemnify, and hold harmless” indicate an intent to restrict indemnification obligations - to third party claims. See, e.g., Travelers Indem. Co. v. Dammann & Co., 594 F.3d 238, 255 (3d Cir.2010) (holding that a party’s duty to “indemnify” must be interpreted in relation 'to the accompanying words “defend”'and “hold harmless,” and “the only sensible reading of [the] clause evidences a requirement that third-party liability exist for the clause to be triggered”); Exelon Generation Co., LLC v. Tugboat DORIS HAMLIN, Civil Action No. 06-0244, 2008 WL 2188333, at *2 (E.D.Pa. May 27, 2008) (finding that “a common sense reading” of an indemnification provision requiring defendant to “indemnify, hold harmless and defend” the plaintiff “suggested] that- it refers only to third-party claims”); see also Atlantic City Assoc., LLC v. Carter & Burgess Consultants, Inc., 453 Fed.Appx. 174, 180 (3d Cir.2011) (noting that Travelers Indem. Co. “foreclosed” the argument that indemnification clauses might apply to first-party disputes between parties tó a contract); Kellers Sys., Inc. v. Transport Int'l Pool, Inc., 172 F.Supp.2d 992, 998-99 (N.D.Ill.2001) (concluding that, under Pennsylvania law, an indemnification provision requiring a party to “defend” and “hold harmless” was limited to third-party claims). .\nSecond, Section 12.1’s reference to “claims, demands, causes of action, damages, liabilities, judgments, losses, fines, awards, penalties, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and other costs of defense” supports the conclusion that only third-party claims are covered by the provision. This is- particularly true given the provision’s reference to “other costs of defense,” which appears to modify the prior list of items.\nThird, Pennsylvania law requires that indemnity clauses be construed narrowly against the party seeking indemnification. See Dunkin’ Donuts Franchising, LLC v. Claudia I, LLC, No. CIV.A. 12-2010, 2014 WL 7008593, at *3 (E.D.Pa. Dec. 12, 2014) (citing Jacobs Constructors, Inc. v. NPS Energy Servs., Inc., 264 F.3d 365, 371 (3d Cir.2001)). This consideration also favors Precision’s interpretation of Section 12.1 as being limited to situations involving third-party claims.\nFinally, Precision correctly notes that certain other indemnity provisions in Article 12 of the MSA only make sense in the context of third-party claims. See, e.g., MSA at § 12.2 (addressing Precision’s indemnity obligations in the context of intellectual property infringement claims); MSA at § 12.3 (providing an exception to Precision’s “defense and indemnification obligations” in cases involving Equitrans’ willful misconduct or sole, negligence); MSA at § 12.4 (providing that Precision’s “defense” of the Indemnitee “shall be undertaken with counsel acceptable to the Indemnitee [being] represented”); MSA at § 12.5 (waiving any rights Precision might have under workers’ compensation statutes or similar laws to limit its indemnity obligations or avoid being joined as' an additional defendant). Based on the foregoing considerations, the Court agrees with Precision that the clear and unambiguous language of MSA Section 12.1, when read in conjunction with other contractual provisions, limits Equitrans’s indemnity rights to situations involving third-party claims.\nThat having been said, the Court notes that Equitrans maintains that it has valid third-party claims based on expenses it incurred to rectify slope failures and 'to make necessary'road repairs. At the same time, Precision has challenged Equitrans’s requests for damages relative to (i) certain roád repair work completed and invoiced by Pennoni & Associates, Inc. (“Pennoni”) prior to the date of the Settlement Agreement (hereafter, “Pennoni' Claims”); and (ii) certain payments made to various landowners and townships as set forth under category “806” on Precision’s Exhibit 70 (Def. Ex. 8-70, p.l, Doc. 43-17) (“Township & Landowner Claims”). Precision contends that most of the invoices documenting payments on the Pennoni Claims predated the Settlement Agreement and thereby are within the category of claims waived by Equitrans pursuant to Paragraphs 6 and 8 of- the Settlement Agreement. Similarly, Precision argues that certain payments made by Equitrans to landowners Kathy and Timothy Fretts, as well as to Jefferson and Gilmore Townships, predate the Settlement Agreement and are among the claims waived by the Settlement Agreement. Precision acknowledges that these Township & Landowner Claims encompassed payments made for various reasons, including “road repair,” “road maintenance,” and “property damage,” among other things. According to Precision, some or all of these payments constituted the “claims and back charges that Equitrans had against Precision” as of April 2013. (See Brandli Dep. Vol; II at 323:18-326-10.) Precision therefore seeks summary judgment with respect to any damage claims ■by Equitrans that relate to Pennoni Claims or Township & Landowner Claims that existed prior to the date of the Settlement Agreement.\nWhat is not presently clear from the record is the extent to which any of these alleged damages can legitimately form the basis of Equitrans’s third-party indemnification claims. Although Paragraphs 6 and 8 of the Settlement Agreement released a broad category of then-existing claims, the agreement also expressly reserved Equi-trans’s right to pursue past and future warranty and indemnity - claims. Because the Court perceives issues of fact relative to Equitrans’s purported third-party claims that are not capable of disposition on the present record, the Court, will not presently grant either party’s motion for summary judgment relative to Count III insofar as it is premised on the Pennoni Claims or the Township & Landowner Claims.\nFinally, the Court notes that Precision has challenged Equitrans’s request for attorney fees. These fees appear to.be an element of Equitrans’s indemnity claim, since the indemnity clause provides the only apparent contractual basis for recovery of attorney’s fees. Because the Court is declining to dispose of the indemnity claim definitively at the present time, however, it is premature' to dispose of Equitrans’s attorney fee request, and Precision’s motion in that regard will therefore be denied.\nD. Precision’s Counterclaim\nIn its responsive pleading (Doc. 6), Precision asserted counterclaims against Equitrans for breach of contract (Count I) and an' alleged violation of Pennsylvania’s Contractor and Subcontractor Payment Act,. 73 P.S. §§ 501 ■ et seq. (Count II). These claims are based on Paragraph 4 of the Settlement Agreement, pursuant to which Equitrans withheld' $987,875.20 of the retainage and agreed to release, same “after all warranty, items have been addressed by Precision as provided by the Contract.” (Settlement Agreement at ¶ 4, Def.’s Ex. 8-97, Doc. 43-28.)\nIn its counterclaims, Precision alleged that “all warranty items [had] been completed” and “no further warranty items could arise that would justify withholding the payment.” (Countercl. at ¶ 10, Doc. 6.)\nEquitrans has moved for summary judgment on both of Precision’s counterclaims. Equitrans acknowledges that it refused to release the $987,875.20 retainer that was withheld under the terms of the June 2013 Settlement Agreement; however, it maintains that its actions were appropriate because Precision’s refusal to repair the slides on the Project demonstrate that all “warranty items” have not been addressed.\nIn responding to Equitrans’s motion, Precision- did not address or otherwise attempt .to defend its counterclaims. Consequently, the Court deems Equitrans’ motion for summary judgment to be unopposed relative to Precision’s two counterclaims, and judgment will be entered in Equitrans’s favor accordingly. See Nykiel v. Borough of Sharpsburg Police Dep’t, 778 F.Supp.2d 573, 578 (W.D.Pa.2011) (a party’s failure to address arguments against its claims in its response to a motion for summary judgment constitutes an “abandonment” of, those claims) (citing authority).\nII. ORDER\nConsistent with the foregoing, Equi-trans’s motion for summary judgment (Doc. 36) will be granted insofar as it relates to Precision’s counterclaims .for breach of contract and Equitrans’s alleged violations of the Contractor and Subcontractor Payment Act. In all other respects, Equitrans’s motion will be denied.. .\nPrecision’s motion for partial''summary judgment (Doc. 40) will be granted with respect to the breach of contract claims asserted in Count I of the' Complaint that are not founded on breach of warranty or indemnity > theories. With respect to the breach of warranty claim in Count II of the Complaint, Precision’s motion will he granted as to the slides numbered “20” through “29” in Precision’s Exhibit 9 (Doc. 43-31) and pertaining to the Shultz, Mar-ling, Ánkrom, Raymont, Tennant, Minor, Efaw, and Fairbanks properties as well as Mileposts 0.26-0.53 and 0.33, at Underwood property. With respect to the indemnity claim in Count III of the Complaint, Precision’s motion, will be granted as to all claims premised exclusively on Equitrans’s first party losses and/or , any losses incurred relative to the aforementioned slides numbered “20” through “29” in Precision’s Exhibit 9 (Doc. 43-31). In all other respects, Precision’s motion for partial summary judgment will be denied.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n. References to \""DSMF at ¶_” refer to Defendant’s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (Doc. 42) and - Plaintiff’s responses thereto (Doc. 49).\n. Citations to \""PSMF at ¶_” refer to Plaintiffs’ Statement of Material Facts (Doc. 38) and Defendant’s responses thereto (Doc. 48).\n. There \""is no dispute for present purposes that the Contract is to be construed and applied- in accordance With Pennsylvania law. (MSA at § 19.1, Def.s Ex. 8-19, Doc. 43-8.)\n. To reiterate, although the Court is concluding that Plaintiff cannot maintain a separate, non-warranty breach of contract claim premised upon alleged breaches of MSA §§ 9.3 and/or 9.7, the Court notes that these provisions' are still relevant to the extent they shed light on the intended scope and meaning of ■the applicable warranty provisions.\n. As suggested by its name, the Marisa Sinkhole is not a slope failure. However, Precision does not presently dispute that the Marisa Sinkhole constitutes an item potentially covered by the terms of its warranty.\n. These Disputed Slides pertain to slope failures at the following properties: Watson (East and Central), Gilbert (North and South), Reserve Coal, Fretts, Milk, Minor, Wiley Fork (Lower/North, Central, and Upper/South), T. Parks/Coastal Lumber, Parks, E, Clark (Mob-ley Run); Underwood (Mileposts 0.01 • and 0.05-0.10); and Titus.\n. For the same reason, Equitrans cannot establish any breach of Precision's indemnity obligations relative to these ten slides, so judgment will be entered in Precision's favor on Count III to the extent that Equitrans’s indemnity claim is premised on costs it incurred in repairing these slides.\n, Although the Court in Travelers Indem.

MEMORANDUM\nPending before the Court are a motion for summary judgment (Doc. 36) filed by Plaintiffs Equitrans Services LLC and Equitrans Investments, LLC, trading as Equitrans, LP (collectively, “Equitrans”) and a\' cross-motion for partial summary judgment (Doc. 40) filed by Defendant Precision Pipeline (“Precision”). For the reasons that follow, the parties’ motions will be granted in part and denied in part.\nBACKGROUND\n■ A. The Contract\nThis civil action arises from a contractual dispute concerning a pipeline construction project known as the “Sunrise Project” (hereafter, the “Project”). The Project involved the construction of approximately 45 miles of natural gas pipeline through Green County, Pennsylvania and Wetzel County, West Virginia. (DSMF at ¶1.).\nIn June 2011, the .parties entered into a contract relative to the Project (hereafter, the “Contract”), pursuant to which Equi-trans agreed to pay Precision an estimated base contract price of $75,358,176.54 for its construction of the pipeline. (See Compl. at ¶ 9, Doc. 1-2; Notice of Removal at ¶ 1, Doc. 1.) The Contract was comprised of a Master Construction Services Agreement (“MSA”), the Sunrise Project Pipeline Construction Specification (“Project Specifications”), the EQT Pipeline Construction Standard, alignment sheets, and erosion and sedimentation control plans, all of which Precision was required to follow during construction. (DSMF at ¶ 13; Def.’s Ex. 8-19 (Doc. 43-8), Ex. 8-25 (Doc. 43-10), Ex. 8-22 (Doc. 43-9), Ex. 8-58 (Doc. 43-12), and 8-60 (Doc. 43-13).)\nThe dispute in this case centers primarily on the meaning and application of certain warranty and indemnification provisions in the Contract. One key warranty provision is Section 8.1 óf the MSÁ, entitled “Warranty of Work,” which states:\nContractor warrants its Work against all deficiencies and\' defects in materials and/or workmanship and as required for [sic] in the Contract Documents, Contractor shall guaranty or warrant its Work for a period of one (1) year from the date of substantial completion of its Work.\n(Def.’s Ex. 8-19, Doc. 43-8.) Another key warranty provision is Article 64 of the Project Specifications, wherein Precision warranted its earthwork as follows:\nContractor shall warrant all earthwork for a period of fifteen (15) months after the retention has been accepted. Earth work shall cover all trench subsidence, any slips or slides and excessive erosion attributable to the improper installation of erosion control devices. ... Contractor agrees to remobilize to repair any earthwork or piping defect within fourteen (14) calendar days after receiving written notification that a project defect is attributable to the Contractor’s workmanship or materials.\n(Def.’s Ex. 8-25, p. 52, Doc. 43-10 (emphasis in the original).) Of potential relevance to these warranty obligations is Section ,9.7 of the MSA, “Quality of Work,” which states:\nContractor will comply with the Contract Documents as they may be modified, will complete the Work in a good and workmanlike manner free from defects and will use the skill and judgment customarily utilized in the trade of Contractor in performing the Work. The Work will at all times meet the approval of the Company. Contractor will inspect all surfaces prior to commencing work. Contractor will not commence work until deficiencies and other surface/subsurface conditions that would adversely affect the integrity of Contractor’s completed Work have been corrected. Contractor shall inform Company immediately should any surface/subsurface be- unacceptable to commence or continue the Work. Contractor’s start of the Work ■constitutes"" Contractor’s acceptance of the existing surfaces and conditions.\n(Def.’s Ex. 8-19, Doc. 43-8.)\nPrecision also assumed the following indemnity obligations pursuant to Section 12.1 of the MSA:\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, Contractor shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless [Equitrans], its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, co-owners, co-lessees and their partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns (“Indemnitees”) from and against any and, all claims, demands, causes of action, damages, liabilities, judgments, losses, fines, awards, penalties, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and other costs of defense (hereinafter “Claims and Expenses”) arising out of or resulting from Contractor’s Work or other performance under this agreement and/or attributable to: (a) the negligent or willful act or omission of Contractor, its subcontractors, suppliers, employees, agents or invitees, or anyone acting under Contractor’s direction or control in connection with the performance of the Work or for whose acts Contractor may be liable, or anyone acting under contractor’s direction or control in connection with the perform-anee of the Work or for whose acts Contractor may be liable; (b) breach by Contractor of any representation or warranty of Contractor; (c) Contractor’s failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement or the Contract Documents; (d) if Contractor transports or hauls Company property (including loading and unloading), any resulting damage or loss; or (e) contractor’s failure to comply with Applicable Laws, Safety Rules, or Permits (defined below), including without limitation any corrective measures which may be required.\n(Defi’s Ex. 8-19, Doc. 43-8.)\nB. The Slope Failures\nIt is undisputed that, following the completion of construction, twenty-nine (29) slides occurred along parts of the right-of-way that Equitrans had obtained for construction of the pipeline. (DSMF at ¶ 19.) Equitrans notified Precision of these occurrences and demanded that the slides be repaired. (PSMF at ¶¶43, 45.) Precision repaired some of the slides, but, as to certain others, Precision offered to make repairs only on a time and materials basis. (PSMF at ¶¶ 46-47.) Equitrans understood that it was contractually obligated to restore each landowner’s property along the right-of-way, so it repaired those landslides that Precision did not repair. (Id. at ¶¶ 40, 48.) Equitrans states that it incurred $6,743,851.14 in damages for repairing slips and slides on the Project. (PSMF at ¶ 85.)\nC. The Road Work\nEquitrans alleges that it provided road bonds to municipalities and local government agencies in order for Precision to utilize certain public roads in connection with its work. (Compl. at ¶ 19, Doc. 1-2.) According to Equitrans, PennDOT and the municipalities demanded that the roads be restored to their pre-construction condition before Equitrans would be released from its road bonds. (Id. at ¶¶ 23-24.)\nPursuant to the EQT Pipeline Construction Standard — an element of the parties’ Contract, Precision agreed that: “Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining and repairing existing roads such that the condition of the road after construction equals the condition of the road prior to construction.” (PSMF at ¶ 79; Pl.s’ Ex. 0 at p. 2121, § 2.2, bullet point 4, Doc. 39-8.) In accordance with the Project Specifications, Precision was required to produce both a pre-construction video of the access roads it would utilize on the Project, capturing their pre-existing conditions, and a post-construction video documenting the as-left condition of the right of way, ancillary sites and access roads restored by Precision. (PSMF at ¶¶ 60-61; Pi’s Ex. M at §§ 19 and 56, Doc. 39-8.)\nPrecision viewed its obligation under these provisions as requiring it to pay for any road damage that it had caused, but not requiring it to pay for road damage caused by others. (PSMF at ¶ 74.) After paying over $1,000,000 toward road repairs, Precision advised Equitrans that it believed these payments had fulfilled its contractual obligations. (Id. at ¶¶ 75-76.) Thereafter, Equitrans paid ■ some $1,292,025.90 in additional road repair costs. (PSMF at ¶ 88.)\nD.The Settlement\nIn June 2013, Equitrans and Precisión entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release\'(“Settlement Agreement”) in an attempt to resolve certain claims related to Precision’s work on the Project. (DSMF at ¶44.) Under Paragraph 6 of the Settlement Agreement, Equitrans agreed to “waive[ ] any and all claims to any backc-harges that it has asserted or could assert against Precision concerning the Project for work completed prior to the date of this Agreement.” (Def.’s Ex. 8-97 at ¶6, Doc. 43-28.) Paragraph 8 of the Settlement Agreement also contained a broad mutual release clause covering “all claims, counterclaims, rights, demands, costs (including attorney’s fees), ""damages, losses, liabilities, actions and causes of action of every nature and description whether known or unknown...” that either party might have as of the date of the Settlement Agreement. (Id. at ¶8). Notwithstanding this broad release, Equitrans expressly ""reserved its right “to assert any and all claims that it has or"" may have in the future against Precision for latent defect and/or warranty and/or indemnity items.” (Id.) Precision likewise “reserve[d] all rights to dispute any claims by [Equitrans] related to latent defects and/or warranty and/or indemnity items.” (Id.)\nE. This Lawsuit.\nEquitrans commenced this lawsuit on November 13, 2013, by filing its complaint in the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas. (See Notice of Removal at ¶ 2, Doc. 1.) Thereafter, the case was removed to this Court. (See Doc. 1.)\n■The complaints sets ""forth three causes of action sounding in: breach of contract (Count I); breach of warranty (Count II); and breach of indemnity obligations (Count III). (See Docs. 1-2.) These counts are all based on Equitrans’s assertion that Precision breached its obligations- under the contract by failing to remedy slope failures, failing to repair damaged roads, and failing to indemnify Equitrans for the costs it incurred in securing necessary repairs. Equitrans . maintains that it is entitled to summary judgment on- all three counts of the Complaint pursuant to the clear and unambiguous language in the Contract.\nPrecision argues that Equitrans’s claims for breach of contract and breach of warranty fail because (1) Precision only warranted against defects in its materials or workmanship arid (2) as to all but two of the slides, Equitrans has failed to present evidence sufficient to show"" that Precision’s defective materials or workmanship (as opposed to Equitrans’s defective design) caused the slides. As to Equitrans’s indemnity claim, Precision argues that’the language of the indemnity clause expressly limits Equitrans to recovering its losses on third-party claims and such losses have not been demonstrated. Precisión further argues that certain ""of Equitrans’s alleged damages Were waived by the June 2013 Settlement Agreement.\nANALYSIS\nAt the heart of this case lies a dispute about the parties’ respective rights and obligations under the Contract. Under Pennsylvania, law, “‘[t]he fundamental rule in interpreting the meaning of a contract is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the contracting parties.’ ” Indian Harbor Ins. Co. v. F & M Equip., Ltd., 804 F.3d 310, 313 (3d Cir.2015) (quoting Murphy v. Duquesne Univ., 565 Pa. 571, 777 A.2d 418, 429 (2001)). The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has summarized the “well established” “division of labor between court and fact-finder when interpreting a contract”:\nFirst, we must determine (as a matter of law) whether contractual language is ambiguous....Hutchison v. Sunbeam Coal Corp., 513 Pa. 192, 519 A.2d 385, 390 (1986). If we determine that the language is unambiguous, we- follow its plain meaning. If, however, we conclude that the language is ambiguous, we leave it to a fact-finder to decide its meaning. See Ins. Adjustment Bureau, Inc. v. Allstate Ins., Inc., 588 Pa. 470, 905 A.2d 462, 469 (2006)....\nPac. Employers Ins. Co. v. Glob. Reinsurance Corp. of Am., 693 F.3d 417, 426 (3d Cir.2012) (interpreting Pennsylvania and New York law; references to New York law omitted).\nOf some relevance here is the fact that the parties’ Contract contains an integration clause. (See MSA at § 19.9, Def.’s Ex. 8-19, Doe. 43-8.) Where the parties have entered into an agreement that represents the parties’ “entire contract” or an integrated contract, parole or extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to explain or vary the terms of the agreement; however, such evidence is admissible for the purpose of resolving an ambiguity in the contract. See U.S. ex rel. Greenmoor, Inc. v. Travelers Cas. & Sur. Co. of Am., No. CIV. A. 06-CV-0234, 2009 WL 4730233, at *44 (W.D.Pa. Dec. 4, 2009) (citing Yocca v. Pittsburgh Steelers Sports, Inc., 578 Pa. 479, 854 A.2d 425, 436 (2004) (stating that “parole evidence is admissible to explain or clarify or resolve th¿ ambiguity, irrespective of whether the ambiguity is created by the language of the instrument or- by extrinsic or collateral circumstances”)). “Thus, while a court must interpret an unambiguous contract ‘according to the natural meaning of its terms,’ a court may ‘look outside the four corners of a contract’ when interpreting an ambiguous contract.” Id. (quoting Bohler-Uddeholm America, Inc. v. Ellwood Group, Inc., 247 F.3d 79, 93 (3d Cir.2001)).\nA contract is ambiguous if it “ ‘is reasonably or fairly susceptible of different constructions and is capable of being\'understood in more senses than one and is obscure in meaning through indefiniteness of expression or has a double meaning.’ ” U.S. ex rel. Greenmoor, Inc., 2009 WL 4730233, at *45 (quoting Bohler-Uddeholm America, Inc., 247 F.3d at 93). In determining whether an ambiguity exists, a “‘court may consider the words of- the contract, the, alternative meaning suggested.by counsel, and the nature,of the objective evidence to. be offered in support of that meaning.’ ” Id. (quoting Bohler-Uddeholm America, Inc., 247 F.3d at 93). “An ambiguity can be either patent, i.e., on the face of the contract,, or latent.” Id. A latent ambiguity “.‘arises from extraneous or collateral facts which make the meaning of a written agreement uncertain although the language thereof, on its face, appears clear and unambiguous.’” Id. (quoting Bohler-Uddeholm America, Inc., 247 F.3d at 93)). “Thus, a latent ambiguity, must be based on a ‘contractual hook’ in that the extrinsic evidence ‘must support an alternative meaning of a specific term or terms contained in the contract, rather than simply support a general\'claim that the parties meant something other than what the contract says on its face.’ ” Id. (quoting Bohler-Uddeholm America, Inc., 247 F.3d at 96).\nA. Equitrans’s Breach of .Contract Claims (Count I)\nFor purposes of its summary judgment motion, Equitrans defines its breach of contract claim in terms of five separate breaches — namely, Precision’s: (1) failure to comply with its warranty obligations; (2) refusal-to indemnify Equitrans for losses arising out of Precision’s work; (3) commencement of work «despite having failed to familiarize itself with the conditions affecting construction; (4) representation to Equitrans, by commencing and proceeding with the work, that it “accepted” the surface and subsurface conditions as is; and (5) failure to restore roads bonded by Equitrans for Precision’s use. (Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. at ¶ 26, Doc. 36.) Items (1) and (2) are essentially redundant of the breach of warranty and indemnity claims at Counts II and III of the complaint and will be addressed in connection with those claims.\nItems (3) and (4) are based on Equi-trans’s interpretations of Sections 9.3 and 9.7 of the MSA and portions of Precision’s April 8, 2011, proposal for the Project (PL’s Ex. P, Doc. 39-9.) According to Equi-trans, these various provisions set forth Precision’s “clear and undisputed duties under the Contract” (PL’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. at 6, Doc. 37), whereby Precision:\n• agreed that its “start of the Work constitute^] its acceptance of the existing surfaces and conditions” (MSA at § 9.7);\n• promised to “inspect all surfaces prior to commencing work” (MSA at § 9.7);\n• represented that it had “familiarized itself with: (A) The conditions affect ing construction at the Project site where the Work is to be performed” (MSA at §9.3);\n• acknowledged it had “thoroughly reviewed [Equitrans’ Requests for Quote]... and the general and local conditions particularly those bearing upon: transportation, disposal, handling and storage of materials; availability of roads, the topography and conditions on the ground;... and all other matters upon which information is reasonably obtainable and which can in any way affect the work or the cost thereof under the RFQ.... All dimensions shall be field checked by [Precision]. Any failure by [Precision] to acquaint themselves with all the available information will not relieve [Precision] from responsibility for estimating properly the difficulty or cost to successfully perform the work...” (Precision’s proposal for the Project, Doc. 39-9 at p. 20);\n• affirmed it would “not commence work until deficiencies and other surface/subsurface conditions that would adversely affect the integrity of [its] completed Work have been corrected” (MSA at § 9.7); and\n• promised to “inform [Equitrans] immediately should any surface/subsurface be unacceptable to commence or continue the work” (MSA at § 9.7).\n(See PL’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. at 6-7, Doc. 37.) Equitrans posits that, by virtue of these contractual representations, Precision assumed total responsibility for the ground surface and subsurface conditions where it performed its work. Specifically,\n[i]f there was a deficiency or other surface/subsurface condition which would affect the integrity of its Work, Precision was to bring it to Equitrans’ attention. At that point, the deficiency or other surface/subsurface condition which would affect the integrity of Precision’s completed Work would be corrected. Once Precision started its Work, it represented to Equitrans its acceptance of the existing surfaces and subsurface conditions of the Project site/route.\n(PL’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. at 7, Doc. 37.)\nPreliminarily, the Court concludes that, although these provisions may have relevance in the context of Equitrans’s breach of warranty claim, they cannot form the basis of an independent breach of contract claim, because the parties’ June 2013 Settlement Agreement effectuated a release of Equitrans’s then-existing claims, other than its claims for breach of warranty and indemnity obligations. At the time the parties entered into the Settlement Agreement, there were a number of outstanding disputes between, them relative to Precision’s work on the Project. Specifically, Equitrans was holding $9,344,733.00. in re-tainage from Precision. (See Def.’s Ex. 8-97, Doc. 43-28.) Precision had submitted numerous “requests for information” (RFIs) in which it sought additional compensation for work that Precision considered to be outside the scope of work called for by the Contract. (Id.) Certain of Precision’s RFIs had been approved by Equi-trans and others had been rejected; (Id.) In addition, Precision had filed claims for mechanic’s liens against Equitrans in Greene County, Pennsylvania and Wetzel County, West Virginia. (Id.) In order “to put to rest all further controversy, to compromise their claims and differences...\', and to effect the release of all claims which have been, or might have been, asserted by or against each of them,” (id.), the parties entered into the Settlement Agreement. The agreement’s “recitals” expressly acknowledge the parties’ intent “to release any and all claims each may have against any Party relating in any way to the Project and the Contract with the exception of warranty claims and indemnity claims...” (Id.) To that end, the agreement contains a broad release clause, applicable to “any and all claims. . ..and causes of action of every nature and description whether known or, unknown., .[that the. parties] have or may have from the beginning of time up to and including the date [of the Settlement Agreement], relating\' in any way to the Contract, the Pennsylvania Lien, the West Virginia Lien, the Project and/or the Dispute, with the exception of the warranty and indemnity claims...” (Id; at 1i 8)\nBased on the unambiguous language of the Settlement Agreement, it is clear that the parties intended to release any breach of contract claims, other than those for alleged breaches of warranty or indemnity obligations, that existed as of the date of the Settlement Agreement. Accordingly, judgment for Precision is appropriate to the extent Equitrans is asserting non-warranty , breach of contract claims based on: (a) Precision’s failure to familiarize itself with the conditions affecting construction prior .to commencing its work and/or (b) Precision’s “representation” to Equitrans, by commencing and proceeding with the .work, that it “accepted” the surface and subsurface conditions of the Project site.\nEquitrans also bases its breach of contract claim on Precision’s failure to restore roads that were bonded by Equitrans for Precision’s use. Precision argues that certain aspects of Equitrans’s damages claim in this regard are barred by the June 2013 Settlement Agreement. In particular, Precision challenges Equitrans’s requests for damages relative to, among other things, road repair work that was completed and invoiced by Pennoni & Associates, Inc. (“Peiinoni”) prior to the date of the Settlement Agreement. As the Court discusses in more ‘ detail below in connection with Equitrans’s indemnity claim, it is not clear from the present state of the record the extent to which these “Pennoni Claims” form the basis of Equitrans’s third-party indemnity claims, which presumably were not waived by the Settlement Agreement. Consequently, to the extent Precision is moving for summary judgment relative to any breach of contract claims premised on payments made by Equitrans for road repairs, existing issues of material fact render- summary judgment inappropriate.\nB. Equitrans’s Warranty Claims (Count II)\nFollowing the completion of the* pipeline’s construction, twenty-nine (29) slides occurred along parts of the right-of-way that Equitrans had obtained for purposes of the construction. (DSMF at ¶ 19.) In Count II of the Complaint, Equitrans alleged that Precision has “breached its warranty obligations by failing to repair the slope failures when notified of the same.... ” (Compl. at ¶ 40.)\nEquitrans’s breach of warranty claim is based on MSA Section 8.1 and Article 64 of the Project Specifications. With regard to MSA Section 8.1, Equitrans interprets this provision as encompassing two separate warranties. The first sentence states that “Contractor warrants its Work against all deficiencies, and defects in materials and/or workmanship, and as required for [sic], in the Contract Documents.” (MSA at § 8.1, Def.’s Ex. 8-19, Doc. 43-8.) Equitrans interprets this sentence as a promise by Precision that the.re will not be any defects or deficiencies in its workmanship or its materials, without any reference to a time limitation. The second sentence of Section 8.1 states that “Contractor shall guaranty or warrant its Work for a period of one (1) year from the date of. substantial. completion, of its Work.” (Id.) Equitrans interprets this sentence as a separate, “bumper-to-bumper” guarantee and warranty of Precision’s “work” that lasts for one year but is not limited to whether a slide or other defect was caused by defective workmanship or materials. Equitrans maintains that any slope failure and/or slip or slide is a deficiency in Precision’s “work” and, since all of the slides at issue occurred within the one-year time period following completion of its work, Equitrans reasons that all of the slides are covered by the “second warranty” in Section 8.1.\nArticle 64 of the Specifications states that the “Contractor shall warrant all earthwork for a period of fifteen (15) months after the retention has been accepted,” and “[ejarthwork shall cover all trench subsidence, any slips or slides and excessive erosion attributable to the improper installation of erosion control devices.” (Project Specification Art. 64, Def.’s Ex. 8-25, Doc. 43-10.) Equitrans maintains that, under the plain language of Article 64, “any” slip or slide constitutes a breach of Precision’s earthwork warranty; thus, by refusing to repair the slope failures that occurred within the warranty time frame, Precision breached its warranties.\nBy contrast, Precision maintains that the warranty provisions in question apply only to defects in its workmanship and materials. Precision concedes that there are issues of fact as to whether defects in its workmanship were responsible for two of the “slides” at issue — namely, the Watson West slide at Milepost 8.57-8,64 (“Watson West”) and the Marisa sinkhole at Milepost 10.13 (the “Marisa Sinkhole”). Accordingly, it does not seek summary judgment relative to these two “slides.”\nAs for the other twenty-seven (27) slope failures, however,\'Precision maintains that there is no evidence to establish that these slides resulted from defects in its workmanship or materials. Precision contends that Equitrans has failed to proffer any expert testimony concerning the cause for the slope failures with respect to ten (10) of the slides — i.e., those numbered “20 through (29)” in Precision’s Exhibit 9 (Doc. 43-31) and pertaining to the Shultz, Mar-ling, Ankrom, Raymont, Tennant, Minor, Efaw, and Fairbanks properties as well as Mileposts 0.26-0.53 and 0.33 at Underwood property. With respect to the remaining seventeen (17) slides — denoted as numbers 1,2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17, 18 and 19 in Precision’s Ex. 9 (Doc. 43-31) (hereafter, the “Disputed Slides”), the parties have presented competing theories as to the root causes of these slope failures, but Precision contends that neither theory can support a finding of liability on its part.\nIn his expert report submitted on behalf of Precision, Steven Pasternack, P.E., Ph. D., opines that the slope failures were caused by: (a) the pipeline being routed on overly steep slopes and (b) the rights-of-way being located over old landslides, active landslides, or soil and rock susceptible to landslides. (PL’s Ex. I, Doc. 39-5.) Precision maintains that, under the terms of the Contract, it was not responsible for these conditions. On the other hand, Equitrans’s expert witness, Jon D. Raab, P.E., opined that the slope failures were attributable to Precision’s workmanship, including its selection of inadequate means and methods to reconstruct stable slopes and its failure in some cases to use engineered stability measures. (Def.’s Ex. 8-67, Doc. 43-15.) Precision interprets Mr. Raab’s report and testimony as establishing that, with regard to each of the 17 Disputed Slides, the slopes required additional engineered stability measures because, they were steeper than a ratio of 2H:1V. Precision insists that it had no responsibility under the Contract for such measures and that all engineering and design responsibility for slide mitigation measures rested with Equitrans. Accordingly, Precision maintains that the record cannot support a finding of any warranty.liability on its part relative to. the seventeen Disputed Slides.\nPrecision’s interpretation of MSA Section 8.1 and Article 64 as warranting only against defects in workmanship, and materials holds some appeal. This Court is inclined .to agree. that the .- more logical interpretation of Section 8.1 is that the first sentence merely describes, the breadth or scope of the warranty (i.e., a warranty against defects in materials and workmanship), while the second sentence describes its length (i.e., one year from substantial completion). To interpret the second sentence as a distinct, stand-alone warranty whereby Precision broadly guaranteed or warranted its work would render the first sentence’s warranty against- defects in workmanship superfluous. This would violate the fundamental principle of contract interpretation that every phrase of a contract should be given meaning and none should be treated as surplusage if any other construction of the contract is rationally possible. See Riverside Sch. Dist. v. Career Tech. Ctr., 104 A.3d 73, 76 (Pa.Commw.Ct.2014) (citation omitted). To avoid this problem and give meaning to both clauses, Equitrans suggests that the “second, warranty” (i.e., the bumper-to-bumper unconditional guarantee of Precision’s work) lasts only one yeap, whereas the “first warranty” relating to workmanship does not reference any time limit. However, it seems unlikely that the parties, having assigned a particular time limit to one warranty, would fail to assign a time limit to the other. Nor does it seem likely that Precision intended to provide an interminable warranty relative to its workmanship.\nPrecision’s proposed interpretation\' of MSA Section 8.1 is buttressed by the language in Article 64, which similarly appears to restrict Precision’s earthwork warranty to issues of defective workmanship. Equitrans’s assertion that Article 64 obligates Precision to repair “any slips or slides” irrespective of them cause ignores the last sentence of the provision, whereby Precision “agree[d] to remobilize to repair any earthwork or piping defect within fourteen (14) calendar days after receiving written notification that a project defect is attributable to the Contractor’s workmanship or materials.” (Project Specification Art. 64, Def.’s Ex. 8-25, Doc. 43-10 (italicized emphasis supplied).) Equi-trans’s interpretation of Article 64 appears to ignore this express contractual provision, which cannot be written out of the contract or disregarded by the Court. See Neuhard v. Range Resources-Appalachia, LLC, 29 F.Supp.3d 461, 474 (M.D.Pa.2014). Nor does it seem likely that the parties intended to create two separate earthwork warranties whereby Precision would remobilize for repairs within 14 days for cases involving defective workmanship, but would be under no particular time constraints with respect to non-workmanship-related repairs.\nThus, the Court is inclined to agree with Precision that MSA Section 8.1 and Article 64 of the Specifications imply warranties related to workmanship, as opposed to an absolute warranty against slope failures irrespective of their cause. Nevertheless, even if the Court accepts Precision’s interpretation of the warranty provisions as limiting its liability to defects in workmanship, this does not entirely end the matter, because the Court must consider what Precision’s contractual “workmanship” responsibilities entailed. Fundamentally, the parties disagree concerning the extent to which the Contract imposed responsibility on Precision for ensuring adequate earthwork stabilization measures.\nAs to this issue, the Court perceives an ambiguity in the Contract which cannot be resolved as a matter of law at the summary judgment stage. Precision maintains that its only responsibilities under the Contract were to construct what Equitrans designed. To support its position, Precision points to the testimony of Equitrans’s project manager and Equitrans’s filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as evidence that Equitrans was responsible to design any necessary slide mitigation measures but failed to incorporate such measures into its design. Precision also interprets Mr. Raab’s report and testimony as establishing that, with regard to each of the 17 Disputed Slides, the terrain required additional engineered stability measures beyond those that were incorporated into Equitrans’s design. Precision insists that it cannot be held contractually liable for any defects in Equi-trans’s design, since it was obligated to adhere to that design.\nOn the other hand, Equitrans has produced some evidence supportive of its position that Precision assumed contractual responsibility relative to earthwork mitigation measures. As previously discussed, Section 9.7 of the MSA, entitled “Quality of Work,” ostensibly obligated Precision to inspect all surfaces prior to commencing its work, immediately inform Equi-trans of any “unacceptable” surface or subsurface conditions, and refrain from commencing work “until deficiencies and other surface/subsurfaee conditions that would adversely affect the integrity of Contractor’s completed work have been corrected.” (Id.) Under the terms of this provision, the “Contractor’s start of the Work constitute[d] . Contractor’s acceptance of the existing surfaces and conditions.” (Id.) Similarly, under Section 9.3 of the MSA, Precision represented that it had familiarized itself with, and accepted, conditions affecting construction at the project site where its work was to be performed. In addition, Section, 9.9 of the MSA required Precision to give Equitrans “prompt written, notice” of any “Company Furnished Property” — including any specifications, drawings, designs, schematics, and technical information — that Precision found to be defective. (MSA at § 9.9(F).) Collectively, these provisions provide some evidence that the parties intended Precision to bear the responsibility of identifying and addressing inherently unfavorable surface or subsurface conditions that might affect the integrity of its work so that enhanced stability measures could be employed. In addition, Article 45 of the Project Specifications addresses Precision’s- responsibility to recontour the project areas to their original condition and, to that end, it recognizes that “[stabilization of disturbed slopes may require the Contractor to determine and install sufficient mitigation.. .to guarantee that slips will not occur.” (Def.’s Ex. 8-25, Doc. 43-10.)\nPrecision argues that, under the “Spearin doctrine,” Equitrans’s impliedly warranted the suitability of its design specifications, and Equitrans cannot rely on “boilerplate” contractual provisions to shift responsibility to Precision for defects in Equitrans’s-design. See United States v. Spearin, 248 U.S. 132, 136-137, 39 S.Ct. 59, 63 L.Ed. 166 (1918) (“[I]f the contractor is bound to build according to plans and specifications prepared by the owner, the contractor will not be responsible for the consequences of defects in the plans and specifications.”); E. Elec. Corp. of New Jersey v. Shoemaker Const. Co., 657 F.Supp.2d 545, 558-59 (E.D.Pa.2009) (“According to Pennsylvania law, an owner impliedly warrants the accuracy and completeness of the plans and specifications that it furnishes to the Contract.”) (citing Rhone Poulenc Rorer Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Newman Glass Works, 112 F.3d 695 (3d Cir.1997)). Thus, a contractor is generally not liable for simply performing work in accordance with owner-issued design specifications. See A.G. Cullen Construction, Inc. v. State System of Higher Education, 898 A.2d 1145, 1156-57 (Pa. Commw.Ct.2006).\nHowever, this doctrine . only applies where the contractor relies oh the owners design specifications. Design specifications “describe in precise detail the materials to be employed and the manner in which the work is to be performed. The contractor has no discretion to deviate from the\'specifications, but is required to follow them as one would a road map.” A.G. Cullen, 898 A.2d at 1156. In contrast, performance specifications “set forth an objective or standard to be achieved, and the successful bidder is expected to exercise his ingenuity in achieving that objective\' or standard of performance, selecting the means and assuming a corresponding responsibility for\' that selection.” Id.; see also Aquatrol Corp. v. Altoona City Auth., 296 Fed.Appx. 221, 224 (3d Cir.2008).\nHere, Equitrans argues that it did not- provide any design specifications that specifically related to earthwork. Equi-trans further contends that the construction “typicals” it provided in its FERC filings were in the nature of performance specifications and that Precision exercised substantial discretion in performing the earthwork. As noted, Article 45 of the Project Specifications addresses Precision’s responsibility- to recontour the project areas to their-original condition and, to that end, it recognizes that “[stabilization of disturbed slopes may require the Contractor to determine and install sufficient mitigation.. .to guarantee that slips will-not-occur.” (Def.’s Ex. 8-25, Doc. 43-10.) Although Precision has provided fairly compelling evidence that it lacked any design responsibilities relative to the Project, the Court concludes that Equitrans has proffered at least enough evidence to demonstrate an ambiguity in the .contract concerning the scope of Precision’s workmanship responsibilities as it pertains to slide mitigation measures. As previously noted, where a contractual ambiguity exists, the fact-finder must determine its meaning. Pac. Employers Ins. Co., 693 F.3d at 426.\nIn addition, the Court concludes that factual issues as to the cause of certain slope failures cannot be resolved as a matter of law at the summary judgment stage. Although Precision claims that Mr. Raab testified unequivocally that the lack of additional engineered stability measures were the .ultimate cause of the slope failures at the seventeen Disputed Slides, the Court does not interpret ,Mr. Raab’s testimony as completely unequivocal in this regard, in actuality, Mr. Raab opined that such measures were “likely” required for areas exceeding a 2H:1V slope, but this was not a “definitive threshold,” and the need for additional measures would entail an individualized inquiry on a “case-by-case basis” depending on the degree to which a slope exceeded a 2H:1V ratio. (Raab Dep. at 99-102, Doc. 43-5.) Based on information obtained from Equitrans’s project manager and the language of the Contract documents,- Mr. Raab agreed that Precision assumed design responsibilities with regard to earthwork and recontouring (see Raab Report at 3-6, Doc. 43-15; Raab Dep. at 69, Doc. 50-5), and he opined that numerous workmanship issues caused or influence the \'instability at the Disputed Slides, including (among other things): the quality of the fill used at the various slide sites, the\'placement of additional fill’over steep natural slopes, the placement of fill on steep slopes without appropriate benching, and inadequate control of groundwater and seepage. To the extent Mr.- Raab’s testimony contains internal inconsistencies or is contradicted by-other evidence of record,- these -are matters for the fact-finder to assess in determining-his credibility. Given the disputed expert-opinion evidence concerning the cause of the seventeen Disputed Slides, -the ambiguities in the Contract concerning Precision’s -responsibilities relative to earthwork mitigation design, and the highly technical nature of these inquiries; the Court is not in a position to resolve the pending cross-motions based on the current state of the record. Accordingly, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment will be denied relative to Count II of the Complaint insofar those motions relate to the seventeen Disputed Slides, the Watson West Slide, and the Marisa Sinkhole.\nThat having been said, the Court agrees with Precision that it is entitled to judgment relative to the remaining ten (10). slides designated as numbers “20 through (29)” in Precision’s Exhibit 9 (Doc. 43-31) that occurred at the Shultz, Mar-ling, Ankrom, Raymont, Tennant, Minor, Efaw, and Fairbanks properties as well as Mileposts 0.26-0.53 and 0.33 at Underwood property. The Court agrees that the cause of these slope failures is a matter involving specialized or technical knowledge as to which expert testimony is required. Because Equitrans failed to proffer any expert opinion as to the cause of these slides, and because the existing evidence of record is otherwise insufficient as a matter of law to establish that the-cause of these slides was attributable to defects in Precision’s workmanship, Precision is entitled to judgment on Count II insofar the warranty claim is premised on these particular slope failures.\nC. Plaintiffs Indemnity Claims (Count HI)\nIn Count III of the Complaint, Equi-trans asserts a claim for breach of Precision’s indemnity obligations arising out of its failure to indemnify Equitrans for certain repairs. (Compl. at ¶40.) In moving for summary judgment on this claim, Equitrans notes that, under Section 12.1 of the MSA, Precision is obligated to indemnify Equitrans for any “damages,.. .losses,. . .costs and expenses” arising out of Precision’s “Work or other performance under [the MSA] and/or attributable to... “breach by Contractor of any representation or warranty” or “Contractor’s failure to comply with any provision of [the MSA] or. the Contract Documents.”. (MSA at § 12.1, Def.’s Ex. 8-19, Doc. No. 43.-8.) Equitrans argues that, due to Precision’s breach of its contractual obligation to perform slope repairs along the pipeline right-of-way, Equitrans incurred costs .in securing the repairs itself. Consequently, Equi-trans argues that it incurred “damages, losses, costs and expenses” due to Precision’s “work” or other performance under the contract,- entitling Equitrans to recover all “damages, losses, costs and expenses” (including attorney fees) resulting from the breach of Precision’s indemnity obligations.\nPrecision maintains that the language of the MSA’s indemnification clause clearly limits Precision’s obligations to situations involving third-party claims. The undersigned finds- this argument persuasive for a number of reasons.\nFirst, Section 12.1 expressly requires Precision to “defend, indemnify, and hold [Equitrans] harmless” , from and against “any claims, .demands, causes of action, damages, • liabilities, judgments, losses, fines, awards, penalties, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and other costs of defense...” Courts in this circuit have recognized that the terms “defend, indemnify, and hold harmless” indicate an intent to restrict indemnification obligations - to third party claims. See, e.g., Travelers Indem. Co. v. Dammann & Co., 594 F.3d 238, 255 (3d Cir.2010) (holding that a party’s duty to “indemnify” must be interpreted in relation \'to the accompanying words “defend”\'and “hold harmless,” and “the only sensible reading of [the] clause evidences a requirement that third-party liability exist for the clause to be triggered”); Exelon Generation Co., LLC v. Tugboat DORIS HAMLIN, Civil Action No. 06-0244, 2008 WL 2188333, at *2 (E.D.Pa. May 27, 2008) (finding that “a common sense reading” of an indemnification provision requiring defendant to “indemnify, hold harmless and defend” the plaintiff “suggested] that- it refers only to third-party claims”); see also Atlantic City Assoc., LLC v. Carter & Burgess Consultants, Inc., 453 Fed.Appx. 174, 180 (3d Cir.2011) (noting that Travelers Indem. Co. “foreclosed” the argument that indemnification clauses might apply to first-party disputes between parties tó a contract); Kellers Sys., Inc. v. Transport Int\'l Pool, Inc., 172 F.Supp.2d 992, 998-99 (N.D.Ill.2001) (concluding that, under Pennsylvania law, an indemnification provision requiring a party to “defend” and “hold harmless” was limited to third-party claims). .\nSecond, Section 12.1’s reference to “claims, demands, causes of action, damages, liabilities, judgments, losses, fines, awards, penalties, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and other costs of defense” supports the conclusion that only third-party claims are covered by the provision. This is- particularly true given the provision’s reference to “other costs of defense,” which appears to modify the prior list of items.\nThird, Pennsylvania law requires that indemnity clauses be construed narrowly against the party seeking indemnification. See Dunkin’ Donuts Franchising, LLC v. Claudia I, LLC, No. CIV.A. 12-2010, 2014 WL 7008593, at *3 (E.D.Pa. Dec. 12, 2014) (citing Jacobs Constructors, Inc. v. NPS Energy Servs., Inc., 264 F.3d 365, 371 (3d Cir.2001)). This consideration also favors Precision’s interpretation of Section 12.1 as being limited to situations involving third-party claims.\nFinally, Precision correctly notes that certain other indemnity provisions in Article 12 of the MSA only make sense in the context of third-party claims. See, e.g., MSA at § 12.2 (addressing Precision’s indemnity obligations in the context of intellectual property infringement claims); MSA at § 12.3 (providing an exception to Precision’s “defense and indemnification obligations” in cases involving Equitrans’ willful misconduct or sole, negligence); MSA at § 12.4 (providing that Precision’s “defense” of the Indemnitee “shall be undertaken with counsel acceptable to the Indemnitee [being] represented”); MSA at § 12.5 (waiving any rights Precision might have under workers’ compensation statutes or similar laws to limit its indemnity obligations or avoid being joined as\' an additional defendant). Based on the foregoing considerations, the Court agrees with Precision that the clear and unambiguous language of MSA Section 12.1, when read in conjunction with other contractual provisions, limits Equitrans’s indemnity rights to situations involving third-party claims.\nThat having been said, the Court notes that Equitrans maintains that it has valid third-party claims based on expenses it incurred to rectify slope failures and \'to make necessary\'road repairs. At the same time, Precision has challenged Equitrans’s requests for damages relative to (i) certain roád repair work completed and invoiced by Pennoni & Associates, Inc. (“Pennoni”) prior to the date of the Settlement Agreement (hereafter, “Pennoni\' Claims”); and (ii) certain payments made to various landowners and townships as set forth under category “806” on Precision’s Exhibit 70 (Def. Ex. 8-70, p.l, Doc. 43-17) (“Township & Landowner Claims”). Precision contends that most of the invoices documenting payments on the Pennoni Claims predated the Settlement Agreement and thereby are within the category of claims waived by Equitrans pursuant to Paragraphs 6 and 8 of- the Settlement Agreement. Similarly, Precision argues that certain payments made by Equitrans to landowners Kathy and Timothy Fretts, as well as to Jefferson and Gilmore Townships, predate the Settlement Agreement and are among the claims waived by the Settlement Agreement. Precision acknowledges that these Township & Landowner Claims encompassed payments made for various reasons, including “road repair,” “road maintenance,” and “property damage,” among other things. According to Precision, some or all of these payments constituted the “claims and back charges that Equitrans had against Precision” as of April 2013. (See Brandli Dep. Vol; II at 323:18-326-10.) Precision therefore seeks summary judgment with respect to any damage claims ■by Equitrans that relate to Pennoni Claims or Township & Landowner Claims that existed prior to the date of the Settlement Agreement.\nWhat is not presently clear from the record is the extent to which any of these alleged damages can legitimately form the basis of Equitrans’s third-party indemnification claims. Although Paragraphs 6 and 8 of the Settlement Agreement released a broad category of then-existing claims, the agreement also expressly reserved Equi-trans’s right to pursue past and future warranty and indemnity - claims. Because the Court perceives issues of fact relative to Equitrans’s purported third-party claims that are not capable of disposition on the present record, the Court, will not presently grant either party’s motion for summary judgment relative to Count III insofar as it is premised on the Pennoni Claims or the Township & Landowner Claims.\nFinally, the Court notes that Precision has challenged Equitrans’s request for attorney fees. These fees appear to.be an element of Equitrans’s indemnity claim, since the indemnity clause provides the only apparent contractual basis for recovery of attorney’s fees. Because the Court is declining to dispose of the indemnity claim definitively at the present time, however, it is premature\' to dispose of Equitrans’s attorney fee request, and Precision’s motion in that regard will therefore be denied.\nD. Precision’s Counterclaim\nIn its responsive pleading (Doc. 6), Precision asserted counterclaims against Equitrans for breach of contract (Count I) and an\' alleged violation of Pennsylvania’s Contractor and Subcontractor Payment Act,. 73 P.S. §§ 501 ■ et seq. (Count II). These claims are based on Paragraph 4 of the Settlement Agreement, pursuant to which Equitrans withheld\' $987,875.20 of the retainage and agreed to release, same “after all warranty, items have been addressed by Precision as provided by the Contract.” (Settlement Agreement at ¶ 4, Def.’s Ex. 8-97, Doc. 43-28.)\nIn its counterclaims, Precision alleged that “all warranty items [had] been completed” and “no further warranty items could arise that would justify withholding the payment.” (Countercl. at ¶ 10, Doc. 6.)\nEquitrans has moved for summary judgment on both of Precision’s counterclaims. Equitrans acknowledges that it refused to release the $987,875.20 retainer that was withheld under the terms of the June 2013 Settlement Agreement; however, it maintains that its actions were appropriate because Precision’s refusal to repair the slides on the Project demonstrate that all “warranty items” have not been addressed.\nIn responding to Equitrans’s motion, Precision- did not address or otherwise attempt .to defend its counterclaims. Consequently, the Court deems Equitrans’ motion for summary judgment to be unopposed relative to Precision’s two counterclaims, and judgment will be entered in Equitrans’s favor accordingly. See Nykiel v. Borough of Sharpsburg Police Dep’t, 778 F.Supp.2d 573, 578 (W.D.Pa.2011) (a party’s failure to address arguments against its claims in its response to a motion for summary judgment constitutes an “abandonment” of, those claims) (citing authority).\nII. ORDER\nConsistent with the foregoing, Equi-trans’s motion for summary judgment (Doc. 36) will be granted insofar as it relates to Precision’s counterclaims .for breach of contract and Equitrans’s alleged violations of the Contractor and Subcontractor Payment Act. In all other respects, Equitrans’s motion will be denied.. .\nPrecision’s motion for partial\'\'summary judgment (Doc. 40) will be granted with respect to the breach of contract claims asserted in Count I of the\' Complaint that are not founded on breach of warranty or indemnity > theories. With respect to the breach of warranty claim in Count II of the Complaint, Precision’s motion will he granted as to the slides numbered “20” through “29” in Precision’s Exhibit 9 (Doc. 43-31) and pertaining to the Shultz, Mar-ling, Ánkrom, Raymont, Tennant, Minor, Efaw, and Fairbanks properties as well as Mileposts 0.26-0.53 and 0.33, at Underwood property. With respect to the indemnity claim in Count III of the Complaint, Precision’s motion, will be granted as to all claims premised exclusively on Equitrans’s first party losses and/or , any losses incurred relative to the aforementioned slides numbered “20” through “29” in Precision’s Exhibit 9 (Doc. 43-31). In all other respects, Precision’s motion for partial summary judgment will be denied.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n. References to ""DSMF at ¶_” refer to Defendant’s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (Doc. 42) and - Plaintiff’s responses thereto (Doc. 49).\n. Citations to ""PSMF at ¶_” refer to Plaintiffs’ Statement of Material Facts (Doc. 38) and Defendant’s responses thereto (Doc. 48).\n. There ""is no dispute for present purposes that the Contract is to be construed and applied- in accordance With Pennsylvania law. (MSA at § 19.1, Def.s Ex. 8-19, Doc. 43-8.)\n. To reiterate, although the Court is concluding that Plaintiff cannot maintain a separate, non-warranty breach of contract claim premised upon alleged breaches of MSA §§ 9.3 and/or 9.7, the Court notes that these provisions\' are still relevant to the extent they shed light on the intended scope and meaning of ■the applicable warranty provisions.\n. As suggested by its name, the Marisa Sinkhole is not a slope failure. However, Precision does not presently dispute that the Marisa Sinkhole constitutes an item potentially covered by the terms of its warranty.\n. These Disputed Slides pertain to slope failures at the following properties: Watson (East and Central), Gilbert (North and South), Reserve Coal, Fretts, Milk, Minor, Wiley Fork (Lower/North, Central, and Upper/South), T. Parks/Coastal Lumber, Parks, E, Clark (Mob-ley Run); Underwood (Mileposts 0.01 • and 0.05-0.10); and Titus.\n. For the same reason, Equitrans cannot establish any breach of Precision\'s indemnity obligations relative to these ten slides, so judgment will be entered in Precision\'s favor on Count III to the extent that Equitrans’s indemnity claim is premised on costs it incurred in repairing these slides.\n, Although the Court in Travelers Indem. Co. interpreted the applicable indemnification language under New Jersey law, its analysis is instructive in this case because the relevant principles of contract construction that were applied in Travelers mirror the principles of contract construction that apply in this case under Pennsylvania law.', 'type': 'majority'}]"

(Dkt. #8.) Micah Skidmore, Esq., appeared on behalf of Plaintiff; JoAnn Dalrymple, Esq., appeared on behalf of Defendant Op-tumRx, Inc. (“OptumRx” or “Defendant”). After careful consideration of the memo-randa in support of- and in opposition to the motion, and in light of the parties’ arguments at the hearing, the Court, for the reasons that follow, DENIES Plaintiffs Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (Dkt. #8).\nFACTS\nMission Pharmacy is an independent retail pharmacy in San Antonio which provides both conventional and compounded prescription medications to patients. (“Am. Compl.,” Dkt. #25 ¶ 9; Dkt. #8 ¶¶1-2.) According to Mission Pharmacy, compounded pharmaceuticals are different from conventional prescription medications because they can .be customized to meet specific patients’ needs. (Am, Compl. ¶ 9; “Hall Aft,” Dkt. # 8, Ex. B ¶ 10.) Mission Pharmacy currently offers walk-in prescription services to patients, but also ships compounded medication to patients via Federal Express. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 10; 17.) Mission Pharmacy states that it complies with applicable licensing requirements in each state where it ships covered prescriptions. (Id. ¶ 17.)\nOptumRx is a pharmacy benefit manager. (Am. Compl. ¶ 11; Dkt. # 15 at 2.) On August 29, 2012, OptumRx entered into a Pharmacy Network Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Morris & Dickson Co. LLC d/b/a Community Independent Pharmacy Network (“CIPN”). (Am. Compl. ¶ 12.) Mission Pharmacy joined the CIPN and became party to the Agreement on July 9, 2013. (Id.) The Agreement requires OptumRx to pay Mission Pharmacy for covered .pharmaceuticals it. dispenses to OptumRx patients. (Id. ¶ 13.)\nThe Agreement between OptumRx and CIPN, to which. Mission Pharmacy became a party in 2013, contains the following provision:\nNo Mail Fulfillment -or Solicitation. Company and Pharmacy shall not solicit a Member for mail delivery or deliver any Covered Prescription Services to a Member by mail, except upon the advance written approval of Administrator, which approval may be refused in Administrator’s sole discretion.\n(Am. Compl. ¶ 14; “Agreement,” Dkt. '# 15, Ex. A-2 § 3-10.) The original Agreement did not define' the' word “mail.” (Am. Compl. ¶ 15.) The 2014 Pharmacy Manual also does not define the word “mail.” (Id. ¶ 18; Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-2.)\nThe Agreement also contains a provision incorporating the “rules, policies, administrative procedures and guidelines” located in OptumRx’s Pharmacy Manual into the Agreement; this provision notifies Members that these rules “may change from time to time.” (Agreement § 3.15.) The Agreement also contains provisions describing the manner in which the contract or materials incorporated by reference may be modified. (Id. § 11.2.)-One such method allows OptumRx -to unilaterally amend the Agreement and incorporate material if it provides “thirty (30) days prior written notice to Company” before such change. (Id. at § 11.2(b).) The contract modification provision states that “[i]f Company does not object to such amendment in writing within such thirty (30) day notice period, Company and Pharmacy shall be deemed to have accepted the proposed amendment.” (Id.)\nOptumRx claims that on December 1, 2014, it published notice via email that its 2015 Pharmacy Manual was available for viewing, and would become effective January 1, 2015. (Dkt. # 15, Ex. A-3.) Mission Pharmacy did not submit written objections to the changes in the Manual. (Dkt. # 8; Dkt. # 15.) The 2015 Pharmacy Manual defines “mail/mailing” as the “action or process of sending Covered Prescription Services through the US mail, shipping via any common carrier (e.g. FedEx, UPS, DHL) or via delivery by any type of courier to Members.” (Am. Compl. ¶ 18; Dkt. #8, Ex. C-3 at 14.) Mission Pharmacy alleges that OptumRx did not obtain Mission Pharmacy’s consent to add this definition of mail; further, Mission Pharmacy states that OptumRx did not provide any consideration for this change to the manual. (Am. Compl. ¶ 21.)\nOn June 2, 2015, OptumRx issued a letter to Mission Pharmacy and all other pharmacies contracting through CIPN explaining that OptumRx was terminating the Agreement with CIPN, and inviting Mission Pharmacy and other independent pharmacies “to contract directly with Op-tumRx.” (Am. Compl. ¶ 22; Dkt. #8, Ex. C-4.) Mission Pharmacy’s Amended Complaint challenges the validity of the termination, and seeks a declaration that such termination “violates article 21.52B of the Texas Insurance Code. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 36, 39(c).)\nOn August 31, 2015, OptumRx issued a Cease and Desist Letter (the “Letter”) demanding that Mission Pharmacy cease “mailing, shipping, and/or delivering” Covered Prescription Services to members.” (Am. Compl. ¶ 23; Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-5.) The Letter requests that Missión Pharmacy submit written confirmation that it will cease shipping prescriptions, and states that failure to respond' “could result in further disciplinary action, up to and including suspension of payment and termination” from the OptumRx Pharmacy Network. (Am. Compl. ¶ 23; Dkt. #8, Ex. C-5.) Mission Pharmacy continued to ship prescriptions. (Am. Compl. ¶24.) On September 14, 2015, Mission Pharmacy notified OptumRx via letter that OptumRx’s “attempt to limit the-shipment of Covered Prescription Services by Mission through a private carrier service is unenforceable.” (Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-6 at 2.) Further, Mission Pharmacy stated that it would not “agree to cease and desist delivery of Covered Prescription Services by third-party, nongovernmental carriers,” arguing that such delivery “is not prohibited by the Agreement and is necessary to serve the needs of patients.” (Id. at 3.)\nOn October 22, 2015, OptumRx sent an e-mail to Mission Pharmacy stating that OptumRx would not “take any action to terminate Mission Pharmacy’s status as a participating pharmacy .., on the basis of Mission Pharmacy’s non-participation status or prohibition against mailing before the earlier of December 31, 2015 or when the court rules on the application for preliminary injunction.” (Dkt. #8, Ex. D-2.)\nOn October 6, 2015, Mission Pharmacy filed suit in the 150th Judicial District Court of Bexar County, Texas seeking a Temporary Restraining Order (Dkt. #1, Ex. A ¶¶ 32-46), as well as Temporary and Permanent Injunctions preventing Op-tumRx from terminating Mission Pharmacy from the pharmacy network for shipping prescriptions through the mail. (Id. ¶¶ 47-49.) On October 14, 2015, OptumRx removed the case to this Court on the basis of diversity. (Id.) On November 2, 2015, Mission Pharmacy filed the instant Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (Dkt. # 8.) On December 10, 2015, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint adding a cause of action for specific performance, which mooted the instant Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (Dkt. #25.) Nonetheless, the parties agreed to conduct the December 11, 2015 preliminary injunction hearing and remedy the procedural issue by filing supplemental responses to the Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (Dkt. #27.) On December 17, 2015, OptumRx filed its Supplemental Response to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \""(Dkt. #28.) Mission Pharmacy filed a Response on Dé cember 18,2015. (Dkt. # 30.)\nLEGAL STANDARD\nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must demonstrate:\n(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted, (3) that, the threatened injury if the 'injunction .is denied, outweighs any harm that will result if the injunction is granted, and (4) that the grant, of an injunction will not disserve the. public interest.\nJanvey v. Alguire, 647 F.3d 585, 595 (5th Cir.2011); Byrum v. Landreth, 566 F.3d 442, 446 (5th Cir.2009). Injunctive relief “should only be granted when the movant has clearly carried the burden of persuasion” on all four requirements. Anderson v. Jackson, 556 F.3d 351, 360 (5th Cir.2009) (citing Holland Am. Ins. Co. v. Succession of Roy, 777 F.2d 992, 997 (5th Cir.1985)); Dennis Melancon, Inc. v. City of New Orleans, 703 F.3d 262, 268 (5th Cir.2012). “A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right,” and “courts' must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief.” Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24, 129 S.Ct. 365, 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008) (quoting Amoco Prod. Co. v. Village of Cambell, AK, 480 U.S. 531, 542, 107 S.Ct. 1396, 94 L.Ed.2d 542 (1987)).\nANALYSIS\nI. Choice of Law Analysis\nThis Court applies Texas choice-of-law rules in determining whether California or Texas law applies to .the instant motion. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pitts., Pa. v. Am. Eurocopter Corp., 692 F.3d 405, 408 (5th Cir.2012) (“[I]n diversity cases, the federal courts must follow conflict of law rules prevailing in the states in which they sit.”) (quoting Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941); see also Benchmark Elec., Inc. v. J.M. Huber Corp., 343 F.3d 719, 726 (5th Cir.2003). Where parties have contractually agreed to a choice-of-law provision, Texas choice-of-law rules favor enforcement, of these provisions, unless the provision “violates a fundamental public policy of Texas.” Smith v. EMC Corp., 393 F.3d 590, 597 (5th Cir.2004) (“In Texas, contractual choice-of-law provisions are typicaljy enforced.”). Parties “cannot by agreement thwart or offend the public policy of the state the law of which ought otherwise to apply.” Int’l Interests, L.P. v. Hardy, 448 F.3d 303, 306-07 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting DeSantis v. Wackenhut Corp., 793 S.W.2d 670, 677 (Tex.1990)).\nChoice of law provisions do not apply to claims other than those involving the agreement- itself. Benchmark Elec., 343 F.3d at 727 (finding choice-of-law provisions “appl[y] only to the interpretation and enforcement of the contractual agreement,” and do not “encompass all disputes between the parties”) (quoting Stier v. Reading & Bates Corp., 992 S.W.2d 423, 433 (Tex.1999)). Accordingly, Texas law applies to claims, unrelated to the contract itself. EMC Corp., 393 F.3d at 597 (finding claims not related to the contract are, in-a diversity- case, “governed by the forum state’s law”).\nHere, the Agreement entered into between CIPN and OptumRx contains two relevant clauses. First, the contract states ' that the “Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California, without' 'giving effect to the conflict of law principles thereof.” (Agreement § 11.11.) Further, the contract states that “any provisions now or hereafter required to be included ... by applicable laws and regulations or any other- Government - Authority of competent jurisdiction over the subject matter hereof . . shall be binding .upon and' enforceable against the parties hereto and deemed incorporated herein.” (Id. at Commercial Addendum § 6.) These contractual choice-of-law provisions, taken together, do not violate Texas public policy and should be enforced. The Court will evaluate Mission Pharmacy’s breach of contract claims by applying California state law.\nMission Pharmacy pled a cause of action based upon the Texas Insurance- Code, which sets forth requirements for health insurance policies wishing to contract with pharmacies in the state of Texas. To ignore the Texas Insurance Code could well violate Texas public policy; further, the Agreement, insofar as-it permits “applicable laws and regulations ... of competent jurisdiction over the subject matter hereof’ to be “binding upon and enforceable against the parties hereto” permits application of the Texas Insurance Code to contract interpretation. (Id.) Accordingly, this Court will apply the Texas Insurance Code to the contract to consider Mission Pharmacy’s Texas Insurance Code claim.\nII. Preliminary Injunction Analysis\nA Likelihood of Success\n“A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 20, 129 S.Ct. 365. In order to prevail on a motion for preliminary injunction, a “plaintiff must present a prima facie case but need not show that he is certain to win” on the merits at summary judgment. Janvey, 647 F.3d at 596; see also Daniels Health Scis., L.L.C. v. Vascular Health Scis., L.L.C., 710 F.3d 579, 582 (5th Cir.2013). “It will ordinarily be enough that the plaintiff has raised questions going to the merits so serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful, as to make them a fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberate investigation.” Allied Home Mortg. Corp. v. Donovan, 830 F.Supp.2d 223, 227 (S.D.Tex.2011) (quoting Sebastian v. Tex. Dep’t of Corr., 541 F.Supp. 970, 975 (S.D.Tex.1982). To assess the likelihood of success on the merits, a court looks to' “standards provided by the substantive law.” Janvey, 647 F.3d at 596 (quoting Roho, Inc. v. Marquis, 902 F.2d 356, 358 (5th Cir.1990). Where a plaintiff cannot establish a - likelihood of success on the merits, the court may deny plaintiffs application for a preliminary injunction and decline to address the remaining factors. See Trottie v. Livingston, 766 F.3d 450, 453 (5th Cir.2014); Anderson v. Jackson, 556 F.3d 351, 360 (5th Cir.2009).\nMission Pharmacy raises three separate causes of action in its Motion for ’Preliminary Injunction: (1). that OptumRx will breach the contract between Mission Pharmacy and OptumRx if it is permitted to terminate the Agreement for the reasons set forth in the Letter .(Dkt. # 8 at 8-9); (2) that OptumRx violated California law when it. entered the amendment to the Agreement (defining the word “mail”) under which OptumRx threatened potential disciplinary action against Mission Pharmacy (id. at 9-10); (3) that termination from the pharmacy network will violate the Texas Insurance Code. (Id. at 10-12.) This Court will separately evaluate whether Mission- Pharmacy is likely to succeed on the merits of each of these three claims.\n1. Likelihood* of Success' of Contract Interpretation Claim\nThe Agreement prohibits fulfillment of prescriptions by mail; Mission Pharmacy does not dispute this. (Agreement § 3.10; Dkt. # 8 at' 8.). However, since the original Agreement did not define “mail,” Mission Pharmacy argues that the definition of “mail” must be restricted to delivery by the United States Postal Service (“U.S. Postal Service”), and that delivery by other, private carriers, such as Federal Express, does not violate the Agreement. (Dkt. # 8 at 8.) Mission Pharmacy ships compounded medications via private carriers rather than via the U.S. Postal Service, and contends that termination from the Pharmacy Network constitutes a breach of the Agreement. .(Id. at 8-9.) Accordingly, resolution of this argument turns upon the determination that “mail,” as stated in the Agreement, is or is not restricted to items delivered by the U.S. Postal Service.\nCalifornia state law governs interpretation of the Agreement. Pursuant to California law, the parties’ intention at the time the agreement was entered into governs contract interpretation. See Yount v. Acuff Rose-Opryland, 103 F.3d 830, 835-36 (9th Cir.1996) (“Under California law, a contract must be so interpreted as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting, so far as the same is ascertainable and lawful.”) (quoting Cal. Civ. Code § 1636). Where there is a dispute as to the meaning of a contract, the Court should look to the words of the contract to determine the intent of the parties at the time the contract was formed. State v. Cont’l Ins. Co.. 55 Cal.4th 186, 195, 145 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 281 P.3d 1000 (Cal.2012) (“Such intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract.”) (quoting AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Ct., 51 Cal.3d 807, 822, 274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253 (Cal.1990)); see also Cal. Civ. Code § 1639. The Court should use “the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions, interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense.” Santisas v. Goodin, 17 Cal.4th 599, 608, 71 Cal.Rptr.2d 830, 951 P.2d 399 (Cal.1998) (quoting Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1638, 1644). The Court will only “look beyond the terms of the writing where it appears that the parties intended to ascribe a technical or special meaning to the terms used.” Acuff Rose, 103 F.3d at 836. Finally, “[a] term is not ambiguous merely because the policies do not define it ... [n]or is it ambiguous because of disagreement concerning the meaning of a phrase.” Cont’l Ins. Co., 55 Cal.4th at 195, 145 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 281 P.3d 1000 (quoting Castro v. Fireman’s Fund Am. Life Ins. Co., 206 Cal.App.3d 1114, 1120, 253 Cal.Rptr. 833 (Cal.Ct.App.1988)). Rather, a term is only “ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions, both of which are reasonable.” Cont’l Ins. Co., 55 Cal.4th at 195, 145 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 281 P.3d 1000 (quoting Waller v. Truck Ins. Exch., Inc., 11 Cal.4th 1, 18, 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619 (Cal.1995)).\nMission Pharmacy argues that the clear and explicit meaning of “mail” in the Agreement is restricted to items delivered by the U.S. Postal Service, citing three cases, as well as Webster’s 1973 New Collegiate Dictionary, to support this argument.\nThe parties entered into this agreement in 2012, a time when private delivery services such as Federal Express and United Parcel Service were frequently used interchangeably with the U.S. Postal Service. Further, it appears that Section 3 of the Agreement serves a variety of purposes, including ensuring that Member Pharmacies comply;.with state and federal,laws regarding drug safety and safeguarding uniform and cost-effective drug distribution. (See Agreement §§ 3.1-3.16.) Accordingly, it seems the prohibition on mail fulfillment does not exist merely because OptumRx prefers that mail-order drugs be delivered by private carriers, and interpreting “mail” to mean only the U.S. Postal Service seems inconsistent with the purpose of Section -3. Mission Pharmacy has not made a “ sufficient showing that the parties’ intent at the time of contracting is clear and unambiguous from the words of the contract. At this time, Mission Pharmacy has not established a likelihood of success on the merits with regards to its contract interpretation claim. :\n2. Likelihood of Success of Contract ■ Modification Claim\nMission Pharmacy also argues that it is entitled to a preliminary injunction , because OptumRx unilaterally amended the definition of “mail” in the Agreement without obtaining - -Mission Pharmacy’s consent or paying consideration. (Dkt. #8 at 9-10; Hall Aff. ¶ 7; Dkt. #8, Ex. C ¶¶ 15-16.) Plaintiff states that termination from the Pharmacy Network based upon an invalid modification amounts to a breach of contract. (Dkt. # 8 at 10.)\nContrary to Plaintiffs assertions, the California Civil Code does not require consideration to support the instant contract modification: “[a] contract in writing may be modified by a contract in writing.” Cal. Civ. Code § 1698(a); see generally Fanucchi & Limi Farms v. United Agri Products, 414 F.3d 1075, 1080-85 (9th Cir.2005) (evaluating contract modification pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code § 1698). Consideration is only required to modify a written contract where the modification is oral. Cal. Civ. Code § 1698(c). Here, the Agreement and modification are written, and OptumRx’s modification does not fail for lack of consideration.\nUnder California law, unilateral contract modification must be “consonant with the duty of good faith and fair dealing.” See Badie v. Bank of America, 67 Cal.App.4th 779, 798, 79 Cal.Rptr.2d 273 (Cal.Ct.App.1998). “[T]he fact that one party reserves the implied power to terminate or modify a unilateral contract is not fatal to its enforcement, if the exercise of power is Subject • to limitations,'' such as fairness and reasonable notice.” Beaver v. Tarsadia Hotels, 978 F.Supp.2d 1124, 1141 (9th Cir.2013) (quoting Asmus v. Pacific Bell, 23 Cal.4th 1, 15-16, 96 Cal.Rptr.2d 179, 999 P.2d 71 (Cal.2000)). The Agreement explicitly defines its scope and provides a modification procedure. The Agreement states that “[a]ny of the rules, policies, administrative procedures and guidelines adopted by Administrator may be distributed in the form of a Pharmacy Manual ... [which] may change from time to time. Any changes shall be binding on Company and Pharmacy.” (Agreement § 3.15.) The Agreement permits OptumRx to modify the Agreement for any reason if it “provides] thirty (30) days prior written notice to Company. If Company does not object to such amendment in writing within such thirty (30) day notice period, Company and Pharmacy shall be deemed to have accepted the proposed amendment.” (Agreement § 11.2(b).)\nOptumRx complied. with the contract modification procedures set forth, in the Agreement when it defined “mail” in the 2015 Pharmacy Manual. On December 1, 2014, OptumRx sent a notice to CIPN, as well as an email notice to Mission. Pharmacy, notifying Member Pharmacies that the 2015 Pharmacy Manual was available online and would take effect January 1, 2015. (“Rendleman Decl.,” Dkt. # 15, Ex. A ¶ 15; Dkt. #15, Ex. A-3.) There are no facts currently before the Court that would suggest that OptumRx’s ability to unilaterally modify the contract is not consonant with the duty of good faith and fair dealing.\nMission Pharmacy does not allege that it objected in ’writing to the 2015 Pharmacy Manual.. (See Dkt. # 8; Dkt. #.22.) Rather, Mission Pharmacy states that it first received actual notice of the change when it received the Letter on August 31, 2015, and- that it timely objected to this new definition in its September 14, 2015 response, when it stated it would continue sending prescriptions out-of-state via private carriers. (Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-6; Dkt. # 22 at 3, n.4.) Importantly, it appears that OptumRx publishes an updated Pharmacy Manual- every year. Mission Pharmacy does not allege that the December. 1, 2014 email was not delivered, nor does it allege a factual basis for believing the 2015 Pharmacy Manual would be identical to :the 2014 Manual. Mission Pharmacy does not allege that OptumRx modified the contract in bad faith. (See Dkt. ## 8, 22, 30.) This Court therefore finds that Mission Pharmacy has not established a likelihood of success of the merits with regard to the contract modification claim.\n3. Likelihood of Success on Texas ■ Insurance Code Claim\nMission Pharmacy argues that this Court should grant a preliminary injunction prohibiting OptumRx from terminating Mission Pharmacy from its Pharmacy Network, because termination for failure to comply with the Agreement will violate the Texas Insurance Code. (Dkt. # 8 at 10-12; Dkt. #22 at 5-7; Dkt. #30 at 1-2.) Liberally construed, Plaintiff asserts three theories to support this argument: (1) terminating Mission Pharmacy for mailing prescriptions without the proper accreditation violates the Texas Insurance Code; (2) failure to terminate pharmacies that do not meet the accreditation requirements but nonetheless mail prescriptions within the state of Texas creates an inconsistent policy which violates the Texas Insurance Code; (3) utilizing the no-fault termination clause to eliminate the intermediary (CIPN) currently administering the agreement violates the Texas Insurance Code. Each of these arguments will be analyzed below.\nThe relevant provision of the Texas Insurance Code states the following:\nA health insurance policy of managed cafe plan that is delivered, issued for delivefy, or renewed or for which a contract or other agreement is executed may not ... deny a pharmacy or pharmacist the right to participate as a contract provider under the policy or plan if the pharmacy or pharmacist agrees to provide pharmaceutical services .that meet all terms and requirements and to include the same administrative, financial, and professional conditions that apply to pharmacies and pharmacists who have been designated as providers under the policy or plan.\nTex. Ins. Code Art. 21.52B § 2(a)(2) (emphasis added). This rarely litigated provision only prohibits the termination of pharmacies in compliance with the administrative, financial, and professional requirements contained in the agreement between the network and the pharmacy. The provision further permits a plan to “establish^ ] reasonable application and re-certification fees for a pharmacy ... provided that such-fees are uniformly charged to each pharmacy under contract to the plan.” Id. § 2(c)(3).\na. Texas Insurance Code and the Prohibition of Unaccredited Mailing\nPlaintiff alleges that terminating Mission Pharmacy for mailing prescriptions without the proper accreditation violates the Texas Insurance Code. (Dkt. # 22 at 6-7.) OptumRx does not have a blanket prohibition on mail-order pharmacies. Rather, OptumRx permits Member Pharmacies to send prescriptions out-of-state if the pharmacy secures additional accreditation. Both the 2014 and 2015 Pharmacy Manuals Plaintiff submitted to the Court state that “[a]ny Pharmacy requesting mail order pharmacy network access must be certified with Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites (FPPS) and accredited by URAC, formerly known as Utilization Review Accreditation Commission, for the applicable accreditation.” (Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-2 at 57; Ex. C-3 at 86; see also Dkt. # 15 at 3, n. 1 & n. 2.) OptumRx states that these requirements' “provide OptumRx with assurance that a pharmacy in its mail network has the appropriate controls and processes in place to safely and effectively dispense medications by mail.” (Dkt. '# 15 at 3-4; Dkt. # 8, Exi C-2 at 57.)\nMission Pharmacy argues that . Op-tumRx’s accreditation requirements for pharmacies shipping prescription medications across state lines violate the Texas Insurance Code because these requirements “[are] not a financial condition ... a professional condition[] or .an administrative condition.” (Dkt. # 8 at 11.) Mission Pharmacy does not further explain this argument. OptumRx explains that the additional accreditation requirements are in place to “assur[e] that a pharmacy in its mail network has the appropriate controls and processes in place to safely and effectively dispense medications by mail.” (Dkt. # 15 at 4.) To date, no Texas case has defined the parameters of “financial,” “professional,” or “administrative” conditions. OptumRx has expressed concern about special handling requirements for certain medications, as well as the difficulty of verifying the identity of the person receiving the medication when medications are sent via mail. (Id. at 3; Rendleman Deck ¶ 6.) Such concerns, insofar as they protect the integrity of the delivered medication and the safety of the patient receiving it, could be considered a professional condition.\n'Mission Pharmacy has not followed the procedures to mail prescriptions' out-of-state via any form of mailing service. (Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-l; Dkt. # 22.) Mission Pharmacy does not argue that the third-party accreditation process itself is unreasonable, that the fees charged pursuant to the third-party accreditation process are unreasonable, or that the fees are charged in a manner that is not uniform. If the prohibition on mailing is a professional condition, Mission Pharmacy’s noncompliance excuses OptumRx from contracting with Mission Pharmacy.\nb. Texas Insurance Code and Alleged Inconsistencies in the Prohibition on Mailing\nMission Pharmacy argues that the prohibition on mailing prescriptions out-of-state is invalid, because OptumRx does not threaten to terminate pharmacies from the OptumRx network for mailing prescriptions within the state of Texas. (Dkt. # 30 at 1-2.) Plaintiff states that this alleged inconsistency between intrastate and out-of-state mailing requirements violates the Texas Insurance Code. (Id.) OptumRx explained that it is' difficult to monitor whether a pharmacy is dispensing medications by mail to patients located in Texas, because “a member may be commuting for work to a nearby town and have prescriptions filled where she works, a member could have relocated within the state, or a member may have required an unexpected prescription while traveling.” (Ren-dleman Decl. ¶ 10.) This concession does not negate OptumRx’s blanket requirement that pharmacies wishing to mail prescriptions to patients must meet accreditation requirements. Mission Pharmacy does not allege that OptumRx has terminated any pharmacy, including Mission Pharmacy, for mailing prescriptions intrastate without accreditation. Accordingly, this alleged inconsistency between intrastate and out-of-state mailing requirements is not arbitrary, and does not cause OptumRx’s credentialing policy to violate the Texas Insurance Code. Mission Pharmacy has not established a likelihood of success on the merits of its second Texas Insurance Code Claim.\nc. Texas Insurance Code and the No-Fault Termination\nPlaintiffs Amended Complaint alleges that OptumRx’s proposed no-fault termination pursuant to the June 2, 2015 letter violates the Texas Insurance Code. (Am. Compl. ¶¶37, 39(c).) Mission Pharmacy supports this - argument only by stating that the Texas Insurance Code “expressly prohibits excluding pharmacy providers like\"" Optuhl for reasons other than a failure to satisfy conditions generally applicable to all- pharmacies within a single plan or policy.” (Dkt. #30 at 1-2.)\nAs explained above, no case has yet defined the parameters of “financial,” “professional,” or “administrative” conditions contained in Article 21.52B of the Texas Insurance Code. Nonetheless, restructuring a business operations model to eliminate an intermediary and allow. a pharmacy benefit plan to contract directly with member pharmacies could be considered either a financial or administrative action. OptumRx notified each pharmacy presently contracting through CIPN that it could avoid any disruption in service by contracting directly with OptumRx, and provided instructions for doing so. (Dkt. #8, Ex. C-4.)\nFurther, Mission Pharmacy does not provide this Court with evidence that any other pharmacy originally contracting through CIPN will, after December 31, 2015, continue to contract through CIPN, or be permitted to contract directly with OptumRx without first executing the Op-tumRx Credentialing Application and Pharmacy Network Agreements described in the. June 2, 2015 letter. (See Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-4.) Additionally, the cases Plaintiff cites in support of this claim are not persuasive as to this issue. Accordingly, this Court finds that Mission Pharmacy has not established a likelihood of success on the merits of its Texas Insurance Code Claim.\n4. Conclusion\nThe court finds, for the reasons stated above, that Mission Pharmacy has not shown it is likely to succeed on the merits of any of its claims against OptumRx. Having found that Mission Pharmacy has not carried its burden of showing that it has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, the Court need not reach the final three requirements for granting a preliminary injunction.\nCONCLUSION.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Mission Specialty’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n. The relevant provision of the contract states: \""No Mail Fulfillment or Solicitation. Company and Pharmacy shall not solicit a Member for mail delivery or deliver any Covered Prescription Services to a Member by mail, [sic] except upon the advance written approval of Administrator, which approval may be refused in Administrator’s sole discretion.” (Agreement § 3.10.)\n. Mission Pharmacy cites Prince v. Poulos, 876 F.2d 30, 32 n. 1 (5th Cir.1989); United States v. Davis, 461 F.2d 83, 87 (5th Cir.1972); and Cachet Residential Builders, Inc. v. Gemini Ins. Co., 547 F.Supp.2d 1028, 1030 (D.Ariz.2007). The holdings in these cases are not binding here, where the contract is interpreted pursuant to California law. Even if the holdings in these cases were binding on this court as á general matter, they are inapplicable here, where the word \""mail” is used in a different context.\nPrince v. Poulos held that \""mail,” for purposes of Rule 25(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, does not include deliveries by Federal Express. However, Rule 25(a) was amended in 1996 to permit delivery by third-party commercial carrier, so long as the commercial carrier can deliver a document within three calendar days. See Fed. R. App. P. 25(a)(2)(B)(ii).\nUnited States v. Davis upheld a district court’s definition of \""mail” as \""any mail, matter or material [that] remains in the-custody of the Postal Service.” Davis 461 F.2d at 87. This case interpreted “mail” only in the context of 18 U.S.C.A. § 1708, a criminal statute regarding mail fraud, and- never reached the question as to whether delivery by a private carrier service, such as Federal Express, should be defined as mail.\nThe court in Cachet Residential Builders found that the definition of \""mail” as used' in Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure 4.2(c), regarding . service of process, is restricted to delivery by the United States Postal Service. The court made this finding based upon the plain language of the rule, which states that \""service may be made [upon an out of state party] by depositing the summons and a copy of the pleading being served in the post office ... Upon return through the post office of the signed receipt, the serving party shall file an affidavit with the court.\"" Id. at 1030 (quoting Ariz. R. Civ. P. 4.2(c)) (emphasis added).\nThis Court could only find one applicable authority to support Plaintiff’s . proposition that “mail” refers only to the United States Postal Service, rather than private delivery services such as Federal Express. In Magnunson v. Video Yesteryear, the Ninth Circuit held that delivery by Federal Express did not constitute \""mail” for purposes of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5. 85 F.3d 1424, 1431 (9th Cir.1996). The Magnunson court made this determination because Rule 5 was promulgated in 1937, when “there [wa]s little doubt that ‘mail’ meant ‘U.S. mail’ ” even though the Court noted that there is \""a question of whether the term ‘mail’ encompasses private delivery services today.” Id. at 1430-31, The Magnunson Court’s reasoning is confined to the interpretation of Rule 5, and is inapplicable here.\n. Indeed,, the Court takes judicial notice of the fact that Federal Express and the U.S. Postal Service have worked together in a service called \""SrtiartPost” where parcels are deposited with Federal Express and then transferred to the U.S. Postal Service for final delivery.\n. Section 3 describes the duties and obligations of OptumRx and the subcontracting Pharmacies, including credentialing requirements, billing specifications, and various accountability méasures. (See Agreement §§ 3.1-3.16.)\n. Further, no matter how this Court defines mail, Mission Pharmacy is not credentialed with OptumRx as a mail-order pharmacy. Mission Pharmacy submitted a Recredentiall-ing Application to OptumRx on September 15, 2014 (Diet. # 8, Ex. C-l), stating that it is not a mail-order pharmacy; Mission Pharmacy does not allege in this application that it meets the necessary credentialing requirements. (Id. at 5.)\n. Plaintiff states that 'Tu]nder California law, Optum may not unilaterally amend the terms of the Agreement. In order to alter the terms of a contract, the modifying party must obtain the counter-party’s consent, and the change must be supported by additional consideration.” (Dkt. # 8 at 9.) This misstates California law. See Cal. Civ. Code § 1698(a) (\""[a] contract in writing must be modified' by a contract in writing”).\n. Indeed, it can be fairly argued that the language at issue here is a clarification and not a modification, as Plaintiff suggests.\n. In the instant Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiff submitted both the 2014 and 2015 Pharmacy Manuals as exhibits to the Court. (Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-2; Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-3.)\n. The case law Plaintiffs cite is distinguishable from the present facts. Plaintiffs cite Tex. Pharmacy Ass’n v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., a case where a pharmacy benefit provider was prohibited under the Texas Insurance Code from denying otherwise compliant pharmacies admission to its.network merely because it had contracted with ¿ sufficient number of pharmacies in a-particular geographic area. 907 F.Supp. 1019, 1024 (W.D.Tex.1995). The language of the case does not support the proposition that a pharmacy benefit provider is required to contract with pharmacies that are not compliant with its administrative, financial, and professional conditions.\nPlaintiffs also cite to Kentucky Ass’n of Health Plans, Inc. v. Miller, 538 U.S. 329, 332, 123 S.Ct. 1471, 155 L.Ed.2d 468 (2003). This case dealt with preemption in the state of Kentucky rather than Texas, and held that Kentucky's \""any willing provider” statutes are laws regulating insurance, and therefore not preempted by ERISA. Neither the holding nor the reasoning in this case has any bearing as to whether Defendants would violate the Texas Insurance Code by terminating Plaintiffs from their network.\n. This court could not find a case, and Plaintiff does not cite to a case, stating either that a pharmacy network’s accreditation requirements were unreasonable, or that a pharmacy network’s termination of a pharmacy for failure to comply with the plan’s administrative, financial, or professional requirements violated the Texas Insurance Code.\n. Mission Pharmacy also argues that the Texas Insurance Code is violated because some pharmacies in the OptumRx network, including OptumRx itself, are permitted to operate mail order pharmacies. (Dkt. # 8 at .11; Dkt. #22 at 7.)\nPlaintiff does not adequately support this claim, because it does not allege that the pharmacies permitted to mail prescriptions out-of-state do not comply with OptumRx’s accreditation requirements. Plaintiff's pleadings explicitly refer to only one other pharmacy, RXPress Pharmacy .(\""RXPress”), located in Fort Worth, Texas. (Dkt. # 8, Exs. A & B.) RXPress was notified that it would be terminated for mailing prescriptions out-of-state if it remained noncompliant, and was actually terminated for this reason. (Dkt. # 8, Ex. B ¶ 19; Dkt. # 8, Ex. B-l.) OptumRx later “rescinded the termination because RXpress agreed to take corrective action to prevent dispensing medications by mail, including delivery by common carrier, to out-of-state members.” (Rendleman Decl. ¶ 20.)\n. Pharmacies wishing to contract directly with OptumRx were instructed to submit a fully executed Credentialing Application and Pharmacy Network Agreement to OptumRx by November Í, 2015. (Dkt. #8, Ex. C-4.)\n. Plaintiff cites three out-of-district cases supporting its argument that District Courts have issued injunctions preventing imminent termination from pharmacy networks. (Dkt. # 30 at 5.) Even if the decisions in these cases were binding on this Court, the facts of the cases are distinguishable from the facts here.\nIn Paduano v. Express Scripts Inc., the District Court for the Eastern District of New York extended a Temporary Restraining Order (\""TRO”) beyond its original 14-day TRO, to prevent multiple pharmacy benefit providers from terminating a pharmacy pending the determination that the pharmacy's claims were or were not subject to various arbitration provisions. No. 2:14-cv-05376-ADS-ARL (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 3, 2014). Notably, the Paduano litigation was brought as an anti-trust action, a circumstance entirely different from that at issue here. Id at *2. Further, the court did not issue a preliminary injunction, nor did it , address the rqerits of the claims as would be necessary for the grant of a preliminary injunction; the court discussed only the portions of Federal Rule 65 relevant to the issuance and extension of a TRO where arbitration was potentially pending. Id. at 56. Accordingly, this case is not instructive to the Court.\nIn Vision Service Plan Insurance, Vision Service Plan (\""VSP”) was enjoined from terminating a chain of optometry practices from its network 'solely because the optometry chain’s business practices did \""not comport with VSP’s preferred business model.” Dr. Mark Lynn & Assocs. PLLC v. Vision Serv. Plan Ins. Co., No. Civ.A.3:05CV-548-S, 2005 WL 2739160, at *1 (W.D.Ky. Oct. 21, 2005). The District Court's injunction was issued pursuant to Kentucky’s \""Any Willing Provider” statute, which only allows- insurance companies to terminate contracting healthcare providers for failure to comply with \""relevant, objective standards ...'reasonably related to services provided.\"" Id. at *2 (quoting Ky. Rev. Stat. § 304.17C-020 & 050) (emphasis added). This, case is readily distinguishable. First, OptumRx is not terminating Mission Pharmacy for failure to utilize a preferred business model. Rather, OptumRx 'changed its own business model, and informed Mission Pharmacy of the steps it could take to .contract with OptumRx pursuant'to this new model, (Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-4.) Second, the Texas Insurance Code, unlike the Kentucky \""Any Willing Provider” statute, has more permissive standards, and does not require \""financial,” \""professional,” of \""administrative” conditions to be “reasonably related to services,” as does the Kentucky statute,\nFinally, Plaintiff cites United Healthcare, a-case where the District Court for the District of Minnesota temporarily enjoined a defendant prescription drug company from issuing prescription discount cards to AARP members using information gained during a then-terminated relationship with the AARP. United Healthcare Ins. Co. v. AdvancePCS, No. CIV.01-2320, 2002 WL 432068 at *19 (D.Minn. March 18, 2002) (aff'd United Healthcare Ins. Co., AARP v. AdvancePCS, 316 F.3d 737 (8th Cir.2002)). The court found that the plaintiff in the case was likely - to prevail on the success of the, merits as to certain violations of the Minnesota Deceptive Trade Practices'Act (\""MDTPA”), and violation of a Minnesota statute providing a civil penalty against entities whose conduct prohibited by the MDTPA targets senior citizens.

After careful consideration of the memo-randa in support of- and in opposition to the motion, and in light of the parties’ arguments at the hearing, the Court, for the reasons that follow, DENIES Plaintiffs Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (Dkt. #8).\nFACTS\nMission Pharmacy is an independent retail pharmacy in San Antonio which provides both conventional and compounded prescription medications to patients. (“Am. Compl.,” Dkt. #25 ¶ 9; Dkt. #8 ¶¶1-2.) According to Mission Pharmacy, compounded pharmaceuticals are different from conventional prescription medications because they can .be customized to meet specific patients’ needs. (Am, Compl. ¶ 9; “Hall Aft,” Dkt. # 8, Ex. B ¶ 10.) Mission Pharmacy currently offers walk-in prescription services to patients, but also ships compounded medication to patients via Federal Express. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 10; 17.) Mission Pharmacy states that it complies with applicable licensing requirements in each state where it ships covered prescriptions. (Id. ¶ 17.)\nOptumRx is a pharmacy benefit manager. (Am. Compl. ¶ 11; Dkt. # 15 at 2.) On August 29, 2012, OptumRx entered into a Pharmacy Network Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Morris & Dickson Co. LLC d/b/a Community Independent Pharmacy Network (“CIPN”). (Am. Compl. ¶ 12.) Mission Pharmacy joined the CIPN and became party to the Agreement on July 9, 2013. (Id.) The Agreement requires OptumRx to pay Mission Pharmacy for covered .pharmaceuticals it. dispenses to OptumRx patients. (Id. ¶ 13.)\nThe Agreement between OptumRx and CIPN, to which. Mission Pharmacy became a party in 2013, contains the following provision:\nNo Mail Fulfillment -or Solicitation. Company and Pharmacy shall not solicit a Member for mail delivery or deliver any Covered Prescription Services to a Member by mail, except upon the advance written approval of Administrator, which approval may be refused in Administrator’s sole discretion.\n(Am. Compl. ¶ 14; “Agreement,” Dkt. \'# 15, Ex. A-2 § 3-10.) The original Agreement did not define\' the\' word “mail.” (Am. Compl. ¶ 15.) The 2014 Pharmacy Manual also does not define the word “mail.” (Id. ¶ 18; Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-2.)\nThe Agreement also contains a provision incorporating the “rules, policies, administrative procedures and guidelines” located in OptumRx’s Pharmacy Manual into the Agreement; this provision notifies Members that these rules “may change from time to time.” (Agreement § 3.15.) The Agreement also contains provisions describing the manner in which the contract or materials incorporated by reference may be modified. (Id. § 11.2.)-One such method allows OptumRx -to unilaterally amend the Agreement and incorporate material if it provides “thirty (30) days prior written notice to Company” before such change. (Id. at § 11.2(b).) The contract modification provision states that “[i]f Company does not object to such amendment in writing within such thirty (30) day notice period, Company and Pharmacy shall be deemed to have accepted the proposed amendment.” (Id.)\nOptumRx claims that on December 1, 2014, it published notice via email that its 2015 Pharmacy Manual was available for viewing, and would become effective January 1, 2015. (Dkt. # 15, Ex. A-3.) Mission Pharmacy did not submit written objections to the changes in the Manual. (Dkt. # 8; Dkt. # 15.) The 2015 Pharmacy Manual defines “mail/mailing” as the “action or process of sending Covered Prescription Services through the US mail, shipping via any common carrier (e.g. FedEx, UPS, DHL) or via delivery by any type of courier to Members.” (Am. Compl. ¶ 18; Dkt. #8, Ex. C-3 at 14.) Mission Pharmacy alleges that OptumRx did not obtain Mission Pharmacy’s consent to add this definition of mail; further, Mission Pharmacy states that OptumRx did not provide any consideration for this change to the manual. (Am. Compl. ¶ 21.)\nOn June 2, 2015, OptumRx issued a letter to Mission Pharmacy and all other pharmacies contracting through CIPN explaining that OptumRx was terminating the Agreement with CIPN, and inviting Mission Pharmacy and other independent pharmacies “to contract directly with Op-tumRx.” (Am. Compl. ¶ 22; Dkt. #8, Ex. C-4.) Mission Pharmacy’s Amended Complaint challenges the validity of the termination, and seeks a declaration that such termination “violates article 21.52B of the Texas Insurance Code. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 36, 39(c).)\nOn August 31, 2015, OptumRx issued a Cease and Desist Letter (the “Letter”) demanding that Mission Pharmacy cease “mailing, shipping, and/or delivering” Covered Prescription Services to members.” (Am. Compl. ¶ 23; Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-5.) The Letter requests that Missión Pharmacy submit written confirmation that it will cease shipping prescriptions, and states that failure to respond\' “could result in further disciplinary action, up to and including suspension of payment and termination” from the OptumRx Pharmacy Network. (Am. Compl. ¶ 23; Dkt. #8, Ex. C-5.) Mission Pharmacy continued to ship prescriptions. (Am. Compl. ¶24.) On September 14, 2015, Mission Pharmacy notified OptumRx via letter that OptumRx’s “attempt to limit the-shipment of Covered Prescription Services by Mission through a private carrier service is unenforceable.” (Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-6 at 2.) Further, Mission Pharmacy stated that it would not “agree to cease and desist delivery of Covered Prescription Services by third-party, nongovernmental carriers,” arguing that such delivery “is not prohibited by the Agreement and is necessary to serve the needs of patients.” (Id. at 3.)\nOn October 22, 2015, OptumRx sent an e-mail to Mission Pharmacy stating that OptumRx would not “take any action to terminate Mission Pharmacy’s status as a participating pharmacy .., on the basis of Mission Pharmacy’s non-participation status or prohibition against mailing before the earlier of December 31, 2015 or when the court rules on the application for preliminary injunction.” (Dkt. #8, Ex. D-2.)\nOn October 6, 2015, Mission Pharmacy filed suit in the 150th Judicial District Court of Bexar County, Texas seeking a Temporary Restraining Order (Dkt. #1, Ex. A ¶¶ 32-46), as well as Temporary and Permanent Injunctions preventing Op-tumRx from terminating Mission Pharmacy from the pharmacy network for shipping prescriptions through the mail. (Id. ¶¶ 47-49.) On October 14, 2015, OptumRx removed the case to this Court on the basis of diversity. (Id.) On November 2, 2015, Mission Pharmacy filed the instant Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (Dkt. # 8.) On December 10, 2015, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint adding a cause of action for specific performance, which mooted the instant Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (Dkt. #25.) Nonetheless, the parties agreed to conduct the December 11, 2015 preliminary injunction hearing and remedy the procedural issue by filing supplemental responses to the Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (Dkt. #27.) On December 17, 2015, OptumRx filed its Supplemental Response to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction. ""(Dkt. #28.) Mission Pharmacy filed a Response on Dé cember 18,2015. (Dkt. # 30.)\nLEGAL STANDARD\nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must demonstrate:\n(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted, (3) that, the threatened injury if the \'injunction .is denied, outweighs any harm that will result if the injunction is granted, and (4) that the grant, of an injunction will not disserve the. public interest.\nJanvey v. Alguire, 647 F.3d 585, 595 (5th Cir.2011); Byrum v. Landreth, 566 F.3d 442, 446 (5th Cir.2009). Injunctive relief “should only be granted when the movant has clearly carried the burden of persuasion” on all four requirements. Anderson v. Jackson, 556 F.3d 351, 360 (5th Cir.2009) (citing Holland Am. Ins. Co. v. Succession of Roy, 777 F.2d 992, 997 (5th Cir.1985)); Dennis Melancon, Inc. v. City of New Orleans, 703 F.3d 262, 268 (5th Cir.2012). “A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right,” and “courts\' must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief.” Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24, 129 S.Ct. 365, 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008) (quoting Amoco Prod. Co. v. Village of Cambell, AK, 480 U.S. 531, 542, 107 S.Ct. 1396, 94 L.Ed.2d 542 (1987)).\nANALYSIS\nI. Choice of Law Analysis\nThis Court applies Texas choice-of-law rules in determining whether California or Texas law applies to .the instant motion. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pitts., Pa. v. Am. Eurocopter Corp., 692 F.3d 405, 408 (5th Cir.2012) (“[I]n diversity cases, the federal courts must follow conflict of law rules prevailing in the states in which they sit.”) (quoting Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941); see also Benchmark Elec., Inc. v. J.M. Huber Corp., 343 F.3d 719, 726 (5th Cir.2003). Where parties have contractually agreed to a choice-of-law provision, Texas choice-of-law rules favor enforcement, of these provisions, unless the provision “violates a fundamental public policy of Texas.” Smith v. EMC Corp., 393 F.3d 590, 597 (5th Cir.2004) (“In Texas, contractual choice-of-law provisions are typicaljy enforced.”). Parties “cannot by agreement thwart or offend the public policy of the state the law of which ought otherwise to apply.” Int’l Interests, L.P. v. Hardy, 448 F.3d 303, 306-07 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting DeSantis v. Wackenhut Corp., 793 S.W.2d 670, 677 (Tex.1990)).\nChoice of law provisions do not apply to claims other than those involving the agreement- itself. Benchmark Elec., 343 F.3d at 727 (finding choice-of-law provisions “appl[y] only to the interpretation and enforcement of the contractual agreement,” and do not “encompass all disputes between the parties”) (quoting Stier v. Reading & Bates Corp., 992 S.W.2d 423, 433 (Tex.1999)). Accordingly, Texas law applies to claims, unrelated to the contract itself. EMC Corp., 393 F.3d at 597 (finding claims not related to the contract are, in-a diversity- case, “governed by the forum state’s law”).\nHere, the Agreement entered into between CIPN and OptumRx contains two relevant clauses. First, the contract states \' that the “Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California, without\' \'giving effect to the conflict of law principles thereof.” (Agreement § 11.11.) Further, the contract states that “any provisions now or hereafter required to be included ... by applicable laws and regulations or any other- Government - Authority of competent jurisdiction over the subject matter hereof . . shall be binding .upon and\' enforceable against the parties hereto and deemed incorporated herein.” (Id. at Commercial Addendum § 6.) These contractual choice-of-law provisions, taken together, do not violate Texas public policy and should be enforced. The Court will evaluate Mission Pharmacy’s breach of contract claims by applying California state law.\nMission Pharmacy pled a cause of action based upon the Texas Insurance- Code, which sets forth requirements for health insurance policies wishing to contract with pharmacies in the state of Texas. To ignore the Texas Insurance Code could well violate Texas public policy; further, the Agreement, insofar as-it permits “applicable laws and regulations ... of competent jurisdiction over the subject matter hereof’ to be “binding upon and enforceable against the parties hereto” permits application of the Texas Insurance Code to contract interpretation. (Id.) Accordingly, this Court will apply the Texas Insurance Code to the contract to consider Mission Pharmacy’s Texas Insurance Code claim.\nII. Preliminary Injunction Analysis\nA Likelihood of Success\n“A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 20, 129 S.Ct. 365. In order to prevail on a motion for preliminary injunction, a “plaintiff must present a prima facie case but need not show that he is certain to win” on the merits at summary judgment. Janvey, 647 F.3d at 596; see also Daniels Health Scis., L.L.C. v. Vascular Health Scis., L.L.C., 710 F.3d 579, 582 (5th Cir.2013). “It will ordinarily be enough that the plaintiff has raised questions going to the merits so serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful, as to make them a fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberate investigation.” Allied Home Mortg. Corp. v. Donovan, 830 F.Supp.2d 223, 227 (S.D.Tex.2011) (quoting Sebastian v. Tex. Dep’t of Corr., 541 F.Supp. 970, 975 (S.D.Tex.1982). To assess the likelihood of success on the merits, a court looks to\' “standards provided by the substantive law.” Janvey, 647 F.3d at 596 (quoting Roho, Inc. v. Marquis, 902 F.2d 356, 358 (5th Cir.1990). Where a plaintiff cannot establish a - likelihood of success on the merits, the court may deny plaintiffs application for a preliminary injunction and decline to address the remaining factors. See Trottie v. Livingston, 766 F.3d 450, 453 (5th Cir.2014); Anderson v. Jackson, 556 F.3d 351, 360 (5th Cir.2009).\nMission Pharmacy raises three separate causes of action in its Motion for ’Preliminary Injunction: (1). that OptumRx will breach the contract between Mission Pharmacy and OptumRx if it is permitted to terminate the Agreement for the reasons set forth in the Letter .(Dkt. # 8 at 8-9); (2) that OptumRx violated California law when it. entered the amendment to the Agreement (defining the word “mail”) under which OptumRx threatened potential disciplinary action against Mission Pharmacy (id. at 9-10); (3) that termination from the pharmacy network will violate the Texas Insurance Code. (Id. at 10-12.) This Court will separately evaluate whether Mission- Pharmacy is likely to succeed on the merits of each of these three claims.\n1. Likelihood* of Success\' of Contract Interpretation Claim\nThe Agreement prohibits fulfillment of prescriptions by mail; Mission Pharmacy does not dispute this. (Agreement § 3.10; Dkt. # 8 at\' 8.). However, since the original Agreement did not define “mail,” Mission Pharmacy argues that the definition of “mail” must be restricted to delivery by the United States Postal Service (“U.S. Postal Service”), and that delivery by other, private carriers, such as Federal Express, does not violate the Agreement. (Dkt. # 8 at 8.) Mission Pharmacy ships compounded medications via private carriers rather than via the U.S. Postal Service, and contends that termination from the Pharmacy Network constitutes a breach of the Agreement. .(Id. at 8-9.) Accordingly, resolution of this argument turns upon the determination that “mail,” as stated in the Agreement, is or is not restricted to items delivered by the U.S. Postal Service.\nCalifornia state law governs interpretation of the Agreement. Pursuant to California law, the parties’ intention at the time the agreement was entered into governs contract interpretation. See Yount v. Acuff Rose-Opryland, 103 F.3d 830, 835-36 (9th Cir.1996) (“Under California law, a contract must be so interpreted as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting, so far as the same is ascertainable and lawful.”) (quoting Cal. Civ. Code § 1636). Where there is a dispute as to the meaning of a contract, the Court should look to the words of the contract to determine the intent of the parties at the time the contract was formed. State v. Cont’l Ins. Co.. 55 Cal.4th 186, 195, 145 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 281 P.3d 1000 (Cal.2012) (“Such intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract.”) (quoting AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Ct., 51 Cal.3d 807, 822, 274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253 (Cal.1990)); see also Cal. Civ. Code § 1639. The Court should use “the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions, interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense.” Santisas v. Goodin, 17 Cal.4th 599, 608, 71 Cal.Rptr.2d 830, 951 P.2d 399 (Cal.1998) (quoting Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1638, 1644). The Court will only “look beyond the terms of the writing where it appears that the parties intended to ascribe a technical or special meaning to the terms used.” Acuff Rose, 103 F.3d at 836. Finally, “[a] term is not ambiguous merely because the policies do not define it ... [n]or is it ambiguous because of disagreement concerning the meaning of a phrase.” Cont’l Ins. Co., 55 Cal.4th at 195, 145 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 281 P.3d 1000 (quoting Castro v. Fireman’s Fund Am. Life Ins. Co., 206 Cal.App.3d 1114, 1120, 253 Cal.Rptr. 833 (Cal.Ct.App.1988)). Rather, a term is only “ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions, both of which are reasonable.” Cont’l Ins. Co., 55 Cal.4th at 195, 145 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 281 P.3d 1000 (quoting Waller v. Truck Ins. Exch., Inc., 11 Cal.4th 1, 18, 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619 (Cal.1995)).\nMission Pharmacy argues that the clear and explicit meaning of “mail” in the Agreement is restricted to items delivered by the U.S. Postal Service, citing three cases, as well as Webster’s 1973 New Collegiate Dictionary, to support this argument.\nThe parties entered into this agreement in 2012, a time when private delivery services such as Federal Express and United Parcel Service were frequently used interchangeably with the U.S. Postal Service. Further, it appears that Section 3 of the Agreement serves a variety of purposes, including ensuring that Member Pharmacies comply;.with state and federal,laws regarding drug safety and safeguarding uniform and cost-effective drug distribution. (See Agreement §§ 3.1-3.16.) Accordingly, it seems the prohibition on mail fulfillment does not exist merely because OptumRx prefers that mail-order drugs be delivered by private carriers, and interpreting “mail” to mean only the U.S. Postal Service seems inconsistent with the purpose of Section -3. Mission Pharmacy has not made a “ sufficient showing that the parties’ intent at the time of contracting is clear and unambiguous from the words of the contract. At this time, Mission Pharmacy has not established a likelihood of success on the merits with regards to its contract interpretation claim. :\n2. Likelihood of Success of Contract ■ Modification Claim\nMission Pharmacy also argues that it is entitled to a preliminary injunction , because OptumRx unilaterally amended the definition of “mail” in the Agreement without obtaining - -Mission Pharmacy’s consent or paying consideration. (Dkt. #8 at 9-10; Hall Aff. ¶ 7; Dkt. #8, Ex. C ¶¶ 15-16.) Plaintiff states that termination from the Pharmacy Network based upon an invalid modification amounts to a breach of contract. (Dkt. # 8 at 10.)\nContrary to Plaintiffs assertions, the California Civil Code does not require consideration to support the instant contract modification: “[a] contract in writing may be modified by a contract in writing.” Cal. Civ. Code § 1698(a); see generally Fanucchi & Limi Farms v. United Agri Products, 414 F.3d 1075, 1080-85 (9th Cir.2005) (evaluating contract modification pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code § 1698). Consideration is only required to modify a written contract where the modification is oral. Cal. Civ. Code § 1698(c). Here, the Agreement and modification are written, and OptumRx’s modification does not fail for lack of consideration.\nUnder California law, unilateral contract modification must be “consonant with the duty of good faith and fair dealing.” See Badie v. Bank of America, 67 Cal.App.4th 779, 798, 79 Cal.Rptr.2d 273 (Cal.Ct.App.1998). “[T]he fact that one party reserves the implied power to terminate or modify a unilateral contract is not fatal to its enforcement, if the exercise of power is Subject • to limitations,\'\' such as fairness and reasonable notice.” Beaver v. Tarsadia Hotels, 978 F.Supp.2d 1124, 1141 (9th Cir.2013) (quoting Asmus v. Pacific Bell, 23 Cal.4th 1, 15-16, 96 Cal.Rptr.2d 179, 999 P.2d 71 (Cal.2000)). The Agreement explicitly defines its scope and provides a modification procedure. The Agreement states that “[a]ny of the rules, policies, administrative procedures and guidelines adopted by Administrator may be distributed in the form of a Pharmacy Manual ... [which] may change from time to time. Any changes shall be binding on Company and Pharmacy.” (Agreement § 3.15.) The Agreement permits OptumRx to modify the Agreement for any reason if it “provides] thirty (30) days prior written notice to Company. If Company does not object to such amendment in writing within such thirty (30) day notice period, Company and Pharmacy shall be deemed to have accepted the proposed amendment.” (Agreement § 11.2(b).)\nOptumRx complied. with the contract modification procedures set forth, in the Agreement when it defined “mail” in the 2015 Pharmacy Manual. On December 1, 2014, OptumRx sent a notice to CIPN, as well as an email notice to Mission. Pharmacy, notifying Member Pharmacies that the 2015 Pharmacy Manual was available online and would take effect January 1, 2015. (“Rendleman Decl.,” Dkt. # 15, Ex. A ¶ 15; Dkt. #15, Ex. A-3.) There are no facts currently before the Court that would suggest that OptumRx’s ability to unilaterally modify the contract is not consonant with the duty of good faith and fair dealing.\nMission Pharmacy does not allege that it objected in ’writing to the 2015 Pharmacy Manual.. (See Dkt. # 8; Dkt. #.22.) Rather, Mission Pharmacy states that it first received actual notice of the change when it received the Letter on August 31, 2015, and- that it timely objected to this new definition in its September 14, 2015 response, when it stated it would continue sending prescriptions out-of-state via private carriers. (Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-6; Dkt. # 22 at 3, n.4.) Importantly, it appears that OptumRx publishes an updated Pharmacy Manual- every year. Mission Pharmacy does not allege that the December. 1, 2014 email was not delivered, nor does it allege a factual basis for believing the 2015 Pharmacy Manual would be identical to :the 2014 Manual. Mission Pharmacy does not allege that OptumRx modified the contract in bad faith. (See Dkt. ## 8, 22, 30.) This Court therefore finds that Mission Pharmacy has not established a likelihood of success of the merits with regard to the contract modification claim.\n3. Likelihood of Success on Texas ■ Insurance Code Claim\nMission Pharmacy argues that this Court should grant a preliminary injunction prohibiting OptumRx from terminating Mission Pharmacy from its Pharmacy Network, because termination for failure to comply with the Agreement will violate the Texas Insurance Code. (Dkt. # 8 at 10-12; Dkt. #22 at 5-7; Dkt. #30 at 1-2.) Liberally construed, Plaintiff asserts three theories to support this argument: (1) terminating Mission Pharmacy for mailing prescriptions without the proper accreditation violates the Texas Insurance Code; (2) failure to terminate pharmacies that do not meet the accreditation requirements but nonetheless mail prescriptions within the state of Texas creates an inconsistent policy which violates the Texas Insurance Code; (3) utilizing the no-fault termination clause to eliminate the intermediary (CIPN) currently administering the agreement violates the Texas Insurance Code. Each of these arguments will be analyzed below.\nThe relevant provision of the Texas Insurance Code states the following:\nA health insurance policy of managed cafe plan that is delivered, issued for delivefy, or renewed or for which a contract or other agreement is executed may not ... deny a pharmacy or pharmacist the right to participate as a contract provider under the policy or plan if the pharmacy or pharmacist agrees to provide pharmaceutical services .that meet all terms and requirements and to include the same administrative, financial, and professional conditions that apply to pharmacies and pharmacists who have been designated as providers under the policy or plan.\nTex. Ins. Code Art. 21.52B § 2(a)(2) (emphasis added). This rarely litigated provision only prohibits the termination of pharmacies in compliance with the administrative, financial, and professional requirements contained in the agreement between the network and the pharmacy. The provision further permits a plan to “establish^ ] reasonable application and re-certification fees for a pharmacy ... provided that such-fees are uniformly charged to each pharmacy under contract to the plan.” Id. § 2(c)(3).\na. Texas Insurance Code and the Prohibition of Unaccredited Mailing\nPlaintiff alleges that terminating Mission Pharmacy for mailing prescriptions without the proper accreditation violates the Texas Insurance Code. (Dkt. # 22 at 6-7.) OptumRx does not have a blanket prohibition on mail-order pharmacies. Rather, OptumRx permits Member Pharmacies to send prescriptions out-of-state if the pharmacy secures additional accreditation. Both the 2014 and 2015 Pharmacy Manuals Plaintiff submitted to the Court state that “[a]ny Pharmacy requesting mail order pharmacy network access must be certified with Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites (FPPS) and accredited by URAC, formerly known as Utilization Review Accreditation Commission, for the applicable accreditation.” (Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-2 at 57; Ex. C-3 at 86; see also Dkt. # 15 at 3, n. 1 & n. 2.) OptumRx states that these requirements\' “provide OptumRx with assurance that a pharmacy in its mail network has the appropriate controls and processes in place to safely and effectively dispense medications by mail.” (Dkt. \'# 15 at 3-4; Dkt. # 8, Exi C-2 at 57.)\nMission Pharmacy argues that . Op-tumRx’s accreditation requirements for pharmacies shipping prescription medications across state lines violate the Texas Insurance Code because these requirements “[are] not a financial condition ... a professional condition[] or .an administrative condition.” (Dkt. # 8 at 11.) Mission Pharmacy does not further explain this argument. OptumRx explains that the additional accreditation requirements are in place to “assur[e] that a pharmacy in its mail network has the appropriate controls and processes in place to safely and effectively dispense medications by mail.” (Dkt. # 15 at 4.) To date, no Texas case has defined the parameters of “financial,” “professional,” or “administrative” conditions. OptumRx has expressed concern about special handling requirements for certain medications, as well as the difficulty of verifying the identity of the person receiving the medication when medications are sent via mail. (Id. at 3; Rendleman Deck ¶ 6.) Such concerns, insofar as they protect the integrity of the delivered medication and the safety of the patient receiving it, could be considered a professional condition.\n\'Mission Pharmacy has not followed the procedures to mail prescriptions\' out-of-state via any form of mailing service. (Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-l; Dkt. # 22.) Mission Pharmacy does not argue that the third-party accreditation process itself is unreasonable, that the fees charged pursuant to the third-party accreditation process are unreasonable, or that the fees are charged in a manner that is not uniform. If the prohibition on mailing is a professional condition, Mission Pharmacy’s noncompliance excuses OptumRx from contracting with Mission Pharmacy.\nb. Texas Insurance Code and Alleged Inconsistencies in the Prohibition on Mailing\nMission Pharmacy argues that the prohibition on mailing prescriptions out-of-state is invalid, because OptumRx does not threaten to terminate pharmacies from the OptumRx network for mailing prescriptions within the state of Texas. (Dkt. # 30 at 1-2.) Plaintiff states that this alleged inconsistency between intrastate and out-of-state mailing requirements violates the Texas Insurance Code. (Id.) OptumRx explained that it is\' difficult to monitor whether a pharmacy is dispensing medications by mail to patients located in Texas, because “a member may be commuting for work to a nearby town and have prescriptions filled where she works, a member could have relocated within the state, or a member may have required an unexpected prescription while traveling.” (Ren-dleman Decl. ¶ 10.) This concession does not negate OptumRx’s blanket requirement that pharmacies wishing to mail prescriptions to patients must meet accreditation requirements. Mission Pharmacy does not allege that OptumRx has terminated any pharmacy, including Mission Pharmacy, for mailing prescriptions intrastate without accreditation. Accordingly, this alleged inconsistency between intrastate and out-of-state mailing requirements is not arbitrary, and does not cause OptumRx’s credentialing policy to violate the Texas Insurance Code. Mission Pharmacy has not established a likelihood of success on the merits of its second Texas Insurance Code Claim.\nc. Texas Insurance Code and the No-Fault Termination\nPlaintiffs Amended Complaint alleges that OptumRx’s proposed no-fault termination pursuant to the June 2, 2015 letter violates the Texas Insurance Code. (Am. Compl. ¶¶37, 39(c).) Mission Pharmacy supports this - argument only by stating that the Texas Insurance Code “expressly prohibits excluding pharmacy providers like"" Optuhl for reasons other than a failure to satisfy conditions generally applicable to all- pharmacies within a single plan or policy.” (Dkt. #30 at 1-2.)\nAs explained above, no case has yet defined the parameters of “financial,” “professional,” or “administrative” conditions contained in Article 21.52B of the Texas Insurance Code. Nonetheless, restructuring a business operations model to eliminate an intermediary and allow. a pharmacy benefit plan to contract directly with member pharmacies could be considered either a financial or administrative action. OptumRx notified each pharmacy presently contracting through CIPN that it could avoid any disruption in service by contracting directly with OptumRx, and provided instructions for doing so. (Dkt. #8, Ex. C-4.)\nFurther, Mission Pharmacy does not provide this Court with evidence that any other pharmacy originally contracting through CIPN will, after December 31, 2015, continue to contract through CIPN, or be permitted to contract directly with OptumRx without first executing the Op-tumRx Credentialing Application and Pharmacy Network Agreements described in the. June 2, 2015 letter. (See Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-4.) Additionally, the cases Plaintiff cites in support of this claim are not persuasive as to this issue. Accordingly, this Court finds that Mission Pharmacy has not established a likelihood of success on the merits of its Texas Insurance Code Claim.\n4. Conclusion\nThe court finds, for the reasons stated above, that Mission Pharmacy has not shown it is likely to succeed on the merits of any of its claims against OptumRx. Having found that Mission Pharmacy has not carried its burden of showing that it has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, the Court need not reach the final three requirements for granting a preliminary injunction.\nCONCLUSION.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Mission Specialty’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n. The relevant provision of the contract states: ""No Mail Fulfillment or Solicitation. Company and Pharmacy shall not solicit a Member for mail delivery or deliver any Covered Prescription Services to a Member by mail, [sic] except upon the advance written approval of Administrator, which approval may be refused in Administrator’s sole discretion.” (Agreement § 3.10.)\n. Mission Pharmacy cites Prince v. Poulos, 876 F.2d 30, 32 n. 1 (5th Cir.1989); United States v. Davis, 461 F.2d 83, 87 (5th Cir.1972); and Cachet Residential Builders, Inc. v. Gemini Ins. Co., 547 F.Supp.2d 1028, 1030 (D.Ariz.2007). The holdings in these cases are not binding here, where the contract is interpreted pursuant to California law. Even if the holdings in these cases were binding on this court as á general matter, they are inapplicable here, where the word ""mail” is used in a different context.\nPrince v. Poulos held that ""mail,” for purposes of Rule 25(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, does not include deliveries by Federal Express. However, Rule 25(a) was amended in 1996 to permit delivery by third-party commercial carrier, so long as the commercial carrier can deliver a document within three calendar days. See Fed. R. App. P. 25(a)(2)(B)(ii).\nUnited States v. Davis upheld a district court’s definition of ""mail” as ""any mail, matter or material [that] remains in the-custody of the Postal Service.” Davis 461 F.2d at 87. This case interpreted “mail” only in the context of 18 U.S.C.A. § 1708, a criminal statute regarding mail fraud, and- never reached the question as to whether delivery by a private carrier service, such as Federal Express, should be defined as mail.\nThe court in Cachet Residential Builders found that the definition of ""mail” as used\' in Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure 4.2(c), regarding . service of process, is restricted to delivery by the United States Postal Service. The court made this finding based upon the plain language of the rule, which states that ""service may be made [upon an out of state party] by depositing the summons and a copy of the pleading being served in the post office ... Upon return through the post office of the signed receipt, the serving party shall file an affidavit with the court."" Id. at 1030 (quoting Ariz. R. Civ. P. 4.2(c)) (emphasis added).\nThis Court could only find one applicable authority to support Plaintiff’s . proposition that “mail” refers only to the United States Postal Service, rather than private delivery services such as Federal Express. In Magnunson v. Video Yesteryear, the Ninth Circuit held that delivery by Federal Express did not constitute ""mail” for purposes of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5. 85 F.3d 1424, 1431 (9th Cir.1996). The Magnunson court made this determination because Rule 5 was promulgated in 1937, when “there [wa]s little doubt that ‘mail’ meant ‘U.S. mail’ ” even though the Court noted that there is ""a question of whether the term ‘mail’ encompasses private delivery services today.” Id. at 1430-31, The Magnunson Court’s reasoning is confined to the interpretation of Rule 5, and is inapplicable here.\n. Indeed,, the Court takes judicial notice of the fact that Federal Express and the U.S. Postal Service have worked together in a service called ""SrtiartPost” where parcels are deposited with Federal Express and then transferred to the U.S. Postal Service for final delivery.\n. Section 3 describes the duties and obligations of OptumRx and the subcontracting Pharmacies, including credentialing requirements, billing specifications, and various accountability méasures. (See Agreement §§ 3.1-3.16.)\n. Further, no matter how this Court defines mail, Mission Pharmacy is not credentialed with OptumRx as a mail-order pharmacy. Mission Pharmacy submitted a Recredentiall-ing Application to OptumRx on September 15, 2014 (Diet. # 8, Ex. C-l), stating that it is not a mail-order pharmacy; Mission Pharmacy does not allege in this application that it meets the necessary credentialing requirements. (Id. at 5.)\n. Plaintiff states that \'Tu]nder California law, Optum may not unilaterally amend the terms of the Agreement. In order to alter the terms of a contract, the modifying party must obtain the counter-party’s consent, and the change must be supported by additional consideration.” (Dkt. # 8 at 9.) This misstates California law. See Cal. Civ. Code § 1698(a) (""[a] contract in writing must be modified\' by a contract in writing”).\n. Indeed, it can be fairly argued that the language at issue here is a clarification and not a modification, as Plaintiff suggests.\n. In the instant Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiff submitted both the 2014 and 2015 Pharmacy Manuals as exhibits to the Court. (Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-2; Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-3.)\n. The case law Plaintiffs cite is distinguishable from the present facts. Plaintiffs cite Tex. Pharmacy Ass’n v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., a case where a pharmacy benefit provider was prohibited under the Texas Insurance Code from denying otherwise compliant pharmacies admission to its.network merely because it had contracted with ¿ sufficient number of pharmacies in a-particular geographic area. 907 F.Supp. 1019, 1024 (W.D.Tex.1995). The language of the case does not support the proposition that a pharmacy benefit provider is required to contract with pharmacies that are not compliant with its administrative, financial, and professional conditions.\nPlaintiffs also cite to Kentucky Ass’n of Health Plans, Inc. v. Miller, 538 U.S. 329, 332, 123 S.Ct. 1471, 155 L.Ed.2d 468 (2003). This case dealt with preemption in the state of Kentucky rather than Texas, and held that Kentucky\'s ""any willing provider” statutes are laws regulating insurance, and therefore not preempted by ERISA. Neither the holding nor the reasoning in this case has any bearing as to whether Defendants would violate the Texas Insurance Code by terminating Plaintiffs from their network.\n. This court could not find a case, and Plaintiff does not cite to a case, stating either that a pharmacy network’s accreditation requirements were unreasonable, or that a pharmacy network’s termination of a pharmacy for failure to comply with the plan’s administrative, financial, or professional requirements violated the Texas Insurance Code.\n. Mission Pharmacy also argues that the Texas Insurance Code is violated because some pharmacies in the OptumRx network, including OptumRx itself, are permitted to operate mail order pharmacies. (Dkt. # 8 at .11; Dkt. #22 at 7.)\nPlaintiff does not adequately support this claim, because it does not allege that the pharmacies permitted to mail prescriptions out-of-state do not comply with OptumRx’s accreditation requirements. Plaintiff\'s pleadings explicitly refer to only one other pharmacy, RXPress Pharmacy .(""RXPress”), located in Fort Worth, Texas. (Dkt. # 8, Exs. A & B.) RXPress was notified that it would be terminated for mailing prescriptions out-of-state if it remained noncompliant, and was actually terminated for this reason. (Dkt. # 8, Ex. B ¶ 19; Dkt. # 8, Ex. B-l.) OptumRx later “rescinded the termination because RXpress agreed to take corrective action to prevent dispensing medications by mail, including delivery by common carrier, to out-of-state members.” (Rendleman Decl. ¶ 20.)\n. Pharmacies wishing to contract directly with OptumRx were instructed to submit a fully executed Credentialing Application and Pharmacy Network Agreement to OptumRx by November Í, 2015. (Dkt. #8, Ex. C-4.)\n. Plaintiff cites three out-of-district cases supporting its argument that District Courts have issued injunctions preventing imminent termination from pharmacy networks. (Dkt. # 30 at 5.) Even if the decisions in these cases were binding on this Court, the facts of the cases are distinguishable from the facts here.\nIn Paduano v. Express Scripts Inc., the District Court for the Eastern District of New York extended a Temporary Restraining Order (""TRO”) beyond its original 14-day TRO, to prevent multiple pharmacy benefit providers from terminating a pharmacy pending the determination that the pharmacy\'s claims were or were not subject to various arbitration provisions. No. 2:14-cv-05376-ADS-ARL (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 3, 2014). Notably, the Paduano litigation was brought as an anti-trust action, a circumstance entirely different from that at issue here. Id at *2. Further, the court did not issue a preliminary injunction, nor did it , address the rqerits of the claims as would be necessary for the grant of a preliminary injunction; the court discussed only the portions of Federal Rule 65 relevant to the issuance and extension of a TRO where arbitration was potentially pending. Id. at 56. Accordingly, this case is not instructive to the Court.\nIn Vision Service Plan Insurance, Vision Service Plan (""VSP”) was enjoined from terminating a chain of optometry practices from its network \'solely because the optometry chain’s business practices did ""not comport with VSP’s preferred business model.” Dr. Mark Lynn & Assocs. PLLC v. Vision Serv. Plan Ins. Co., No. Civ.A.3:05CV-548-S, 2005 WL 2739160, at *1 (W.D.Ky. Oct. 21, 2005). The District Court\'s injunction was issued pursuant to Kentucky’s ""Any Willing Provider” statute, which only allows- insurance companies to terminate contracting healthcare providers for failure to comply with ""relevant, objective standards ...\'reasonably related to services provided."" Id. at *2 (quoting Ky. Rev. Stat. § 304.17C-020 & 050) (emphasis added). This, case is readily distinguishable. First, OptumRx is not terminating Mission Pharmacy for failure to utilize a preferred business model. Rather, OptumRx \'changed its own business model, and informed Mission Pharmacy of the steps it could take to .contract with OptumRx pursuant\'to this new model, (Dkt. # 8, Ex. C-4.) Second, the Texas Insurance Code, unlike the Kentucky ""Any Willing Provider” statute, has more permissive standards, and does not require ""financial,” ""professional,” of ""administrative” conditions to be “reasonably related to services,” as does the Kentucky statute,\nFinally, Plaintiff cites United Healthcare, a-case where the District Court for the District of Minnesota temporarily enjoined a defendant prescription drug company from issuing prescription discount cards to AARP members using information gained during a then-terminated relationship with the AARP. United Healthcare Ins. Co. v. AdvancePCS, No. CIV.01-2320, 2002 WL 432068 at *19 (D.Minn. March 18, 2002) (aff\'d United Healthcare Ins. Co., AARP v. AdvancePCS, 316 F.3d 737 (8th Cir.2002)). The court found that the plaintiff in the case was likely - to prevail on the success of the, merits as to certain violations of the Minnesota Deceptive Trade Practices\'Act (""MDTPA”), and violation of a Minnesota statute providing a civil penalty against entities whose conduct prohibited by the MDTPA targets senior citizens.

SCHEINDLIN, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE."",""text"":""OPINION AND ORDER\nSHIRAA. SCHEINDLIN, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThese related actions are for enforcement of the Guarantee obligations of Caesars Entertainment Corporation’s (“CEC”) on Notes issued by Caesars Entertainment Operating Company (“CEOC”). Plaintiffs now seek partial summary judgment arguing that CEC violated section 316(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the “TIA”), as well as certain provisions of the Indenture governing the Notes, when in August 2014, CEC amended the Indenture to remove the Guarantee (the “August Transaction”) without plaintiffs’ consent. CEC raises several arguments in support of its position that the August Transaction did not violate either the TIA or the Indenture. One of those arguments is that the August Transaction is “irrelevant” because the Guarantee had already been removed when, after two transactions in May 2014, CEOC ceased to be a wholly owned subsidiary of CEC (the “May Transactions”). Because there is genuine dispute of material fact as to whether CEOC continued to be a wholly owned subsidiary after the May Transactions, summary judgment is DENIED.\nII. BACKGROUND\nA. CEC\nCEC, through its subsidiaries, is one of the largest gaming companies in the world. CEC’s principal operating subsidiary is CEOC, a chapter 11 debtor. In 2008, CEC was acquired in a leveraged buyout transaction sponsored by Apollo Global Management (“Apollo”) and TPG Capital, LP (“TPG”). In connection with that transaction, CEOC issued roughly $24 billion in debt, the proceeds of which were used by Apollo and TPG to acquire CEC’s publicly traded shares.\nB. The 2016 Notes Indenture\nPursuant to an Indenture dated September 28, 2005, CEOC issued $750 million of 2016 Notes. MeehanCombs is the beneficial holder of approximately $15,318,000 of the 2016 Notes. Danner is also a beneficial holder of 2016 Notes.\nThe Notes are governed by an Indenture which is qualified under the TLA. CEC’s Guarantee is found in section 1501 of the Indenture. CEC agreed to guarantee the payment of all principal and interest due on the Notes, and that its guarantee obligations would be “unconditional, irrespective of ... any waiver or consent by any Holder .... ” However, section 1503 of the Indenture states that the guarantee may be released under certain limited circumstances, including if CEOC “ceases for any reason to be a ‘wholly owned subsidiary’ of [CEC] (as such term is defined in Rule l-02(z) of [ ] Regulation S-X promulgated by the [Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) ]).”\nSection 508 of the Indenture provides that “[notwithstanding any other provision of th[e] Indenture^ each holder’s right] to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and ... interest on ... [any] Security ... [is] absolute and unconditional ... [and] shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.” Section 902 of the Indenture states that while supplemental indentures may be entered into with the consent of a majority of holders, “no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby,” alter the principal or interest on any security.\nC.The May 2014 Transactions\nIn May 2014, CEC sold five percent of its stock (the “5% Stock Sale”). After the 5% Stock Sale, CEC issued a press release stating that because CEOC was no longer a “wholly owned subsidiary” of CEC, CEC’s guarantee obligations had been terminated under CEOC’s bond indentures.\nThen, later that month, CEOC allocated another 6% of its shares for distribution to certain employees as part of a “performance incentive plan” (the “PIP”). Following the PIP, CEC again publicly stated that its guarantee obligations for CEOC’s bonds had been terminated.\nD. The August 2014 Transaction\nOn May 15, 2014, CEC received a letter on behalf of certain funds that held a majority of CEOC’s 2016 outstanding unsecured notes (the “Majority Holders”). The letter stated that contrary to CEC’s press release, the guarantee for the 2016 Notes remained in place notwithstanding the effect the 5% Stock Sale may have had on CEOC’s other indentures. In the August Transaction, CEC and CEOC agreed to purchase the Majority Holders’ notes for approximately $155 million, which covered all principal and interest due on the notes, in exchange for the Majority Holders’ consent to amendments that removed CEC’s guarantee.\nThe August Transaction was memorialized in a Note Purchase and Support Agreement dated August 12, 2014, and the transaction closed on August 22, 2014. On the day the transaction closed, CEC, CEOC, and the indenture trustee executed supplemental indentures that removed from the Indentures all provisions relating to the Guarantee. Plaintiffs did not consent to the indenture amendments, and were not given an opportunity to participate in the August Transaction.\nE. CEOC’s Corporate Governance Following the May Transactions\nBefore June 27, 2014, CEOC’s Board consisted of two employee directors. On that date, one of the directors resigned and six new Board members were appointed, two of which CEC contends were independent directors. The two directors selected independent legal counsel. On July 30, 2014, CEOC’s Board formed a Governance Committee consisting of the two independent directors. These directors, together with the other members of the CEOC Board, approved the August Transaction.\nF. CEOC’s Bankruptcy\nCEOC filed for bankruptcy protection on January 15, 2015. Under the terms of the Indenture, this constituted an “Event of Default” which triggered CEC’s obligations under the Guarantee. Plaintiffs demanded payment on the Guarantee, and CEC refused payment.\nIII. LEGAL STANDARD\nSummary judgment is appropriate where, “viewing the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party ... ‘there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’” “In making this determination ... we resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.” “A fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law, and an issue of fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.”\n“The moving party bears the burden of showing the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact.” To defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must “‘do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts, and may not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation.’”\n“‘The function of the district court in considering the motion for summary judgment is not to resolve disputed questions of fact but only to determine whether, as to any material issue, a genuine factual dispute exists.’” “‘Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge.’”\nIV. APPLICABLE LAW\nA. The Trust Indenture Act\nThe TIA provides that instruments to which it applies must be issued under an indenture that has been qualified by the SEC. The requirements of such indentures are “designed to vindicate a federal policy of protecting investors.”\nSection 316 of the TIA relates to collective action clauses. For example, it is permissible for a majority of noteholders to direct the trustee to exercise its powers under the indenture or for not less than seventy-five percent of noteholders “to consent on behalf of the holders of all such indenture securities to the postponement of any interest payment for a period not exceeding three years from its due date.” Section 316(a)’s terms are permissive— meaning an indenture can expressly exclude such majority action.\nHowever, section 316(b) is mandatory. It states that:\nNotwithstanding any other provision of the indenture to be qualified, the right of any holder of any indenture security to receive payment of the principal of and interest on such indenture security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such indenture security, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder ... ,\nThus, section 316(b) acts to protect a bondholder’s right to receive payment of both principal and interest.\nSection 316(b) addressed earlier practices whereby majority bondholders— often controlled by insiders — used collective or majority action clauses to change the terms of an indenture, to the detriment of minority bondholders. As a result of section 316(b), an issuer cannot — outside of bankruptcy — alter its obligation to pay bondholders without the consent of each bondholder. In this way, section “316(b) was designed to provide judicial scrutiny of debt readjustment plans to ensure their equity.”\n“Congress and the SEC were aware that the holdout problem would frustrate some workouts, but the regulators wanted to impede workouts that took place outside of regulatory and judicial control. The SEC wanted trust indenture legislation that would bring contractual recapitaliza-tions under the jurisdiction of the federal bankruptcy court.” One reason was the concern that, “[b]y buying or otherwise controlling a majority of a distressed company’s bonds[,] ... equity owners could vote to suspend or reduce payments on the bonds, thus allowing value to move down the corporate chain to the equity holders.” This outcome would not be permitted under bankruptcy law. It would be “an inversion of the normal priorities in a corporate bankruptcy by which a company’s debt holders are paid off before the equity holders.”\nB. Contract Interpretation\nUnder New York law, “[t]he court’s function in interpreting a contract is to apply the meaning intended by the parties, as derived from the language of the contract in question.” “[T]he best evidence of what parties to a written agreement intend is what they say in their writing. Thus' a written agreement that is complete, clear and unambiguous on its face must be enforced according to the plain meaning of its terms.”\n“The question of whether a written contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court.” “Contract language is unambiguous when it has a definite and precise meaning, unattended by danger of misconception in the purport of the contract itself, and concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion.” However, contract language is ambiguous if “the terms of the contract could suggest more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs, practices, usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.” “Evidence outside the four corners of the document as to what was really intended but unstated or misstated is generally inadmissible to add to or vary the writing; evidence as to custom and usage is considered, as needed, to show what the parties’ specialized language is fairly presumed to have .meant.”\nV. DISCUSSION\nSection 1503(3) of the Indenture releases the Guarantee when CEOC ceases to be “wholly owned” by CEC “as such term is defined in Rule l-02(z) of the Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC[].” Under Regulation S-X, a subsidiary is “wholly owned” if “substantially all of [its] outstanding voting shares are owned by its parent and/or the parent’s other wholly owned subsidiaries.”\nCEC argues that the validity of the August Transaction “is irrelevant if the Guarantee was released [under section 1503(3) ] as a result of either or both of the May Transactions.” According to CEC, “[pjlaintiffs have failed to show that CEOC is still ‘wholly owned’ by CEC; at most, whether CEC holds ‘substantially all’ of CEOC’s stock is an issue of fact that cannot be resolved on summary judgment.”\nA. Indenture Section 508 Does Not Bar Release of the Guarantee\nSection 508 of the Indenture states that\nNotwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and ... interest on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.\nThus, section 508 includes the language mandated by section 316(b) of the TIA, but goes further, stating that the right to receive payment of the principal of and interest is “absolute and unconditional.” Applying New York law to a similar provision modifying section 316(b), the Second Circuit has instructed that the absolute and unconditional language should be given effect. The Second Circuit has also interpreted the phrase “notwithstanding any other provision,” explaining that “[t]his Court has recognized many times that under New York law, clauses similar to the phrase ‘[notwithstanding any other provision’ trump conflicting contract terms.”\nRelying on Bank of New York v. First Millennium, Inc., plaintiffs argue that section 508 of the Indenture “ ‘overrides’ any conflicting provisions of the Indenture,” including the Guarantee release provisions. In First Millennium, the FDIC, as receiver for the issuer of certain notes, claimed that it was not liable for the full amount then due on the notes, because a “ ‘limited recourse provision’ of the master indenture limits the funds that the note-holders can pursue for repayment of their notes to those set aside as collateral.” The Second Circuit stated that “[b]y its plain terms, the ‘absolute and unconditional’ right to repayment granted to the note-holders by the indenture overrides the conflicting limited recourse provision, and allows the noteholders to seek repayment from all the assets of the trust.” More specifically, the reason for this conflict was that under New York law, “ ‘an order or promise to pay out of a particular fund is not unconditional.’ ” As a consequence, an absolute and unconditional right to payment “cannot be limited to funds labeled ‘collateral’ in the transaction documents.”\nUnder New York law, a contract should be read to give effect to all of its provisions, and courts should avoid interpretations that render contract terms meaningless or superfluous. In BOKF, I explained that a guarantee release provision does not conflict with a guarantee providing an “absolute and unconditional” right to payment. CEC had argued that the guarantees at issue in that case were not really meant to be guarantees at all, but were simply included for SEC reporting purposes. To support that argument textually, CEC argued that if the guarantees had been unconditional, then the indentures would not have included release provisions. I rejected this argument, explaining that\n[T]he mere fact that CEC could be released from the Guarantee under certain circumstances says little about the nature of the Guarantee itself. That is, simply because a Guarantee may be easily terminated ... does not indicate that the Guarantee was something other than an unconditional guarantee of full and punctual payment when due.\nPlaintiffs attempt to distinguish the import of BOKF — which is that the Guarantee does not conflict with provisions that permit its release. They note that here the “absolute and unconditional” language is not in the Guarantee provision, but in the “notwithstanding provision” of the Indenture.\nHowever, this is a distinction without a difference. Guarantees “must be strictly construed according to their terms” and the “guarantor’s obligation must be narrowly construed and cannot be extended by construction beyond the plain and explicit language of the contract.” Here, the Indenture explicitly permits the removal of the Guarantee under section 1503. Under New York law, when a guarantee is “absolute and unconditional,” this means that it is a guarantee of payment, rather than collection. “As explained more than 13[5] years ago by the New York Court of Appeals:\nThe fundamental distinction between a guaranty of payment and one of collection is, that in the first case the guarantor undertakes unconditionally that the debtor will pay, and the creditor may, upon default, proceed directly against the guarantor, without taking any steps to collect of the principal debtor, and the omission or neglect to proceed against him is not (except under special circumstances) any defense to the guarantor; while in the second case the undertaking is that if the demand cannot be collected by legal proceedings the guarantor will pay, and consequently legal proceedings against the principal debtor, and a failure to collect of him by those means are conditions precedent to the liability of the guarantor .... ”\nThus, CEC’s payment obligation under the Guarantee did not arise until after an event of default, and when it did, plaintiffs had the right to pursue claims directly against CEC under the Guarantee.\nIt follows that had CEC attempted to invoke section 1503(3) to remove the Guarantee after its obligations under the Guarantee were triggered, this would patently violate section 508 (unless CEC received unanimous noteholder consent). But removal of the Guarantee under the terms of section 1503(3) prior to the time the payment obligation under the Guarantee becomes due could violate the terms of section 508 in some contexts, but not in others. Unlike plaintiffs’ interpretation, this reading of the terms of the Indenture gives meaning to each of its terms. It is also consistent with First Millennium and the rule that “under New York law, clauses similar to the phrase Notwithstanding any other provision’ trump conflicting contract terms.” In First Millennium, the nonrecourse provision presented a clear conflict with the absolute and unconditional right to payment under the facts of that case — the notes at issue were due and owing, the noteholders had not been paid in full, and the FDIC was attempting to limit recovery “out of a particular fund.”\nIn sum, plaintiffs’ interpretation of section 508 fails to give appropriate meaning to the terms of the Guarantee and the provisions that permit the release of that Guarantee. In addition — and in contrast to the cases cited by plaintiffs — plaintiffs have not shown that there is a conflict between sections 508 and 1503(3).\nB. CEC Is Not Precluded from Asserting’ that the May Transactions Released the Guarantee\nPlaintiffs contend that CEC is barred from relying on the May Transactions based on the law of judicial admissions and judicial estoppel. According to plaintiffs, CEC has taken the contrary position — i.e., that the May Transactions did not release the Guarantee — in related lawsuits brought by BOKF, N.A. and UMB Bank, N.A. to enforce CEC’s guarantees of different notes. For _ example, CEC stated in its brief opposing BOKF’s motion for partial summary judgment that:\nAs a consequence of the August [] Transaction, the Guarantee was released under the last paragraph of Section 12.02(c) of the [Second Lien] Indenture. That is because the transaction provided an independent basis for the release of CEC’s guarantee of the 2016 and 2017 Notes, which were the last outstanding “Existing Notes” defined in the indenture, as CEC’s guarantee of the other “Existing Notes” had already been discharged or released.\nIn addition, “David Sambur, an Apollo partner who serves on CEC’s Board and testified as CEC’s Rule 30(b)(6) witness in this action, made a nearly identical statement in a sworn declaration CEC submitted with its opposition papers.” However, these statements do not support preclusion under either the law of judicial admissions or judicial estoppel.\nThe statements are not judicial admissions because they concern the legal effect of certain transactions, and only statements of fact can be binding judicial admissions. Moreover, the statements do not unequivocally state that CEC believed that the May Transactions were insufficient to release the Guarantee.\nBoth before and after this litigation, CEC’s position has been that the August Transaction ‘“provided an independent basis’ for releasing the Guarantee on the 2016 Notes.” After the 5% Stock Sale, CEC filed an SEC Form 8-K reporting that its “guarantee of CEOC’s outstanding secured and unsecured notes was automatically released.” Likewise, CEC explained in its opposition to BOKF’s motion for partial summary judgment that:\nOn May 6, 2014, CEC and CEOC announced a transaction (the “B-7 Transaction”) designed to repay CEOC’s near-term maturities. Under the B-7 Transaction, CEOC obtained $1.75 billion of new term loans, which were used to repay, among other things, nearly all outstanding notes that were set to mature before 2016. As a condition of the new financing, however, the lenders who negotiated the transaction demanded that CEC exercise its right under various indentures — including the BOKF and UMB Indentures — to release CEC’s parent guarantee. Because of the benefits to CEOC of obtaining the new loans, CEC and CEOC assented to the lenders’ conditions. Accordingly, on May 5, 2014, CEC sold 5% of CEOC’s stock to three unaffiliated investors for a total of $6.15 million. The sale did not modify the Indenture, and the Indenture did not require any consent by the BOKF (or UMB) Holders. As a consequence of the sale, CEOC was no longer a “Wholly Owned Subsidiary” of CEC, and the Guarantee was released. Following this transaction, under Rule 3-10 and the Indenture, CEOC began to file its own audited financial statements with the SEC.\nOn the day of the August Transaction, CEC filed a Form 8-K stating the Guarantee had been released following the 5% Stock Sale, and also “notfing] that CEOC had provided additional notices to the trustees for outstanding secured notes reaffirming its position [as stated in earlier notices based in part on the 5% Stock Sale] that CEC’s guarantee had been released as a result of the guarantee of CEOC’s unsecured notes being released.” On the basis of these statements and the overall context, plaintiffs fail to show that CEC has taken inconsistent positions in describing the effect of the May Transactions.\nPlaintiffs’ arguments regarding judicial estoppel also lack merit. “ ‘A party invoking judicial estoppel must show that (1) the party' against whom the estop-pel is asserted took an inconsistent position in a prior proceeding and (2) that position was adopted by the first tribunal in some manner, such as by rendering a favorable judgment.’ ” However, as just described, the relevant statements are not unequivocally inconsistent. Accordingly, CEC’s argument based on the May Transactions is not barred by the doctrines of judicial admission or judicial estoppel.\nC. There Is a Genuine Dispute of Material Fact as to Whether CEOC Was Wholly Owned by CEC Following the May Transactions\nSection 1503 of the Indenture states that “[CEC] shall be released from all of its obligations under the Guarantee” if, among other things, CEOC “ceases for any reason to be a ‘wholly owned subsidiary’ of [CEC] (as such term is defined in Rule l-02(z) of the Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC).” Regulation S-X sets forth. accounting rules and requirements for financial statements filed under the federal securities laws. Under Regulation S-X, a subsidiary is “wholly owned” if “substantially all of [its] outstanding voting shares are owned by its parent and/or the parent’s other wholly owned subsidiaries.” “Voting shares” are defined to mean “the sum of all rights, other than as affected by events of default, to vote for election of directors and/or the sum of all interests in an unincorporated person.”\nThe parties agree that following the 5% Stock Sale, CEC owned roughly 95% of CEOC’s common shares, and that following the PIP, CEC owned roughly 89%. Plaintiffs argue that 89% ownership “falls within the plain meaning of ‘substantially all,’” and then direct the Court to guidance issued by SEC Staff interpreting Regulation S-X. CEC argues that the guidance is irrelevant because it has “nothing to do with guarantees of public debt, but the unrelated issue of ‘push-down accounting,’ the principles governing the financial .statements of target companies in certain circumstances following an acquisition.” But the Indenture makes the applicable section of Regulation S-X relevant by referencing it in section 1503(3).\nPlaintiffs rely heavily on the quantitative measures set forth in EITF D-97. According to that document:\nIn determining whether a company has become substantially wholly owned, the SEC staff has stated that push-down accounting would be required if 95 percent or more of the company has been acquired (unless the company has outstanding public debt or preferred stock that may impact the acquirer’s ability to control the form of ownership of the company), permitted if 80 percent to 95 percent has been acquired, and prohibited if less than 80 percent of the company is acquired.\nPutting aside that this Staff guidance refers to “substantially wholly owned” and not “wholly owned,” it is unclear from the above why push-down accounting is 'permitted, but not required, at the 80% to 95% level.\nMoreover, plaintiffs fail to establish the qualitative factors discussed in the SEC Staff guidance. Plaintiffs argue that CEC continued to control 100% of the shares that vote for the election of directors because (i) CEOC’s Certifícate of Incorporation permits directors to appoint directors to fill vacancies, and (ii) the new Board was elected on June 27, 2014 through that process. Plaintiffs likewise claim that the ‘“form of ownership[]’ of CEOC remained in CEC’s control” following the May Transactions because the minority shareholders did not vote for the new directors in June 2014.\nHowever, if the directors were elected pursuant to the provision in 'the Certificate of Incorporation that allows directors to fill vacancies, then the failure of the minority shareholders to vote is irrelevant. Filling vacancies in this way is not done through voting shares. For this reason, Delaware law contemplates that while vacancies can be filled by the Board, annual elections must be held at which Board members can be removed for any reason.\nPlaintiffs also argue that “CEC’s 89% voting interest in CEOC has enabled CEC to dominate CEOC completely, dictating all aspects of CEOC’s existence, including day-to-day operations as well as extraordinary actions such as asset sales, related-party transactions, and CEOC’s bankruptcy filing.” Not one of these examples relates directly to voting shares or Board elections. To the extent that they relate to controlling the “form of ownership,” at all, they do so based on the premise that CEC controls CEOC’s Board. However,\ndetermining whether CEC “controls” CEOC requires consideration of fact specific issues — including the expansion of CEOC’s Board in June 2014, the addition of independent CEOC directors, the creation of a CEOC Board Governance Committee in July 2014 (comprising those independent directors) that was empowered to evaluate material financial transactions and those that might have involved a material conflict with CEC, and the retention of independent legal and financial advisors to investigate potential claims by CEOC against CEC.\nIn other words, there are genuine disputes of material fact that preclude summary judgment.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nBecause there are genuine disputes of material fact as to whether the May Transactions independently released the Guarantee, I do not address whether the August Transaction violated the terms of either the TIA or the Indenture. For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs’ motions are DENIED. The Clerk of the Court is directed to close these motions [Dkt. Nos: 67 and 74 in No. 14-cv-7091 and Dkt.

Both EITF D-97 and SAB 112 refer to the concept of “substantially wholly owned.” But neither Regulation S-X nor the Indenture use the term \""substantially wholly owned.” Rather, the question under Regulation S-X and the Indenture is whether, for purposes of determining whether CEOC is a wholly owned subsidiary, CEC owns substantially all of the voting shares of CEOC. The concept of \""substantially wholly owned” makes even less sense when one considers another provision of Regulation S-X — Rule 3-10. That provision deals explicitly with parent guarantees. Rather than borrow the definition of \""wholly owned subsidiary” from Rule 2-10, it uses the concept of a \""100% owned subsidiary,” which is met when \""all of [the subsidiary’s] outstanding voting shares are owned, either directly or indirectly, by its parent company.” 17 C.F.R. § 210.3-10(h)(1). The SEC has explained why “100% owned” is used in Rule 3-10:\nUnder [Staff Accounting Bulletin] 53, a subsidiary was ’wholly owned' if all of its outstanding voting shares and any outstanding securities convertible into its voting shares were owned, either directly or indirectly, by its parent company. This meaning differs from the general definition of 'wholly-owned subsidiary' in Rule l-02(aa) of Regulation S-X. Rule l-02(aa) treats a subsidiary as wholly owned if substantially all of its voting shares are held by its parent company. We proposed that the meaning of \""wholly owned” for the purposes of Rule 3-10 would be, in large part, the same as the staff’s analysis under SAB 53.\nSEC Release Notice, Release No. 55 (2000).\n.

SCHEINDLIN, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE.', 'text': 'OPINION AND ORDER\nSHIRAA. SCHEINDLIN, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThese related actions are for enforcement of the Guarantee obligations of Caesars Entertainment Corporation’s (“CEC”) on Notes issued by Caesars Entertainment Operating Company (“CEOC”). Plaintiffs now seek partial summary judgment arguing that CEC violated section 316(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the “TIA”), as well as certain provisions of the Indenture governing the Notes, when in August 2014, CEC amended the Indenture to remove the Guarantee (the “August Transaction”) without plaintiffs’ consent. CEC raises several arguments in support of its position that the August Transaction did not violate either the TIA or the Indenture. One of those arguments is that the August Transaction is “irrelevant” because the Guarantee had already been removed when, after two transactions in May 2014, CEOC ceased to be a wholly owned subsidiary of CEC (the “May Transactions”). Because there is genuine dispute of material fact as to whether CEOC continued to be a wholly owned subsidiary after the May Transactions, summary judgment is DENIED.\nII. BACKGROUND\nA. CEC\nCEC, through its subsidiaries, is one of the largest gaming companies in the world. CEC’s principal operating subsidiary is CEOC, a chapter 11 debtor. In 2008, CEC was acquired in a leveraged buyout transaction sponsored by Apollo Global Management (“Apollo”) and TPG Capital, LP (“TPG”). In connection with that transaction, CEOC issued roughly $24 billion in debt, the proceeds of which were used by Apollo and TPG to acquire CEC’s publicly traded shares.\nB. The 2016 Notes Indenture\nPursuant to an Indenture dated September 28, 2005, CEOC issued $750 million of 2016 Notes. MeehanCombs is the beneficial holder of approximately $15,318,000 of the 2016 Notes. Danner is also a beneficial holder of 2016 Notes.\nThe Notes are governed by an Indenture which is qualified under the TLA. CEC’s Guarantee is found in section 1501 of the Indenture. CEC agreed to guarantee the payment of all principal and interest due on the Notes, and that its guarantee obligations would be “unconditional, irrespective of ... any waiver or consent by any Holder .... ” However, section 1503 of the Indenture states that the guarantee may be released under certain limited circumstances, including if CEOC “ceases for any reason to be a ‘wholly owned subsidiary’ of [CEC] (as such term is defined in Rule l-02(z) of [ ] Regulation S-X promulgated by the [Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) ]).”\nSection 508 of the Indenture provides that “[notwithstanding any other provision of th[e] Indenture^ each holder’s right] to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and ... interest on ... [any] Security ... [is] absolute and unconditional ... [and] shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.” Section 902 of the Indenture states that while supplemental indentures may be entered into with the consent of a majority of holders, “no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby,” alter the principal or interest on any security.\nC.The May 2014 Transactions\nIn May 2014, CEC sold five percent of its stock (the “5% Stock Sale”). After the 5% Stock Sale, CEC issued a press release stating that because CEOC was no longer a “wholly owned subsidiary” of CEC, CEC’s guarantee obligations had been terminated under CEOC’s bond indentures.\nThen, later that month, CEOC allocated another 6% of its shares for distribution to certain employees as part of a “performance incentive plan” (the “PIP”). Following the PIP, CEC again publicly stated that its guarantee obligations for CEOC’s bonds had been terminated.\nD. The August 2014 Transaction\nOn May 15, 2014, CEC received a letter on behalf of certain funds that held a majority of CEOC’s 2016 outstanding unsecured notes (the “Majority Holders”). The letter stated that contrary to CEC’s press release, the guarantee for the 2016 Notes remained in place notwithstanding the effect the 5% Stock Sale may have had on CEOC’s other indentures. In the August Transaction, CEC and CEOC agreed to purchase the Majority Holders’ notes for approximately $155 million, which covered all principal and interest due on the notes, in exchange for the Majority Holders’ consent to amendments that removed CEC’s guarantee.\nThe August Transaction was memorialized in a Note Purchase and Support Agreement dated August 12, 2014, and the transaction closed on August 22, 2014. On the day the transaction closed, CEC, CEOC, and the indenture trustee executed supplemental indentures that removed from the Indentures all provisions relating to the Guarantee. Plaintiffs did not consent to the indenture amendments, and were not given an opportunity to participate in the August Transaction.\nE. CEOC’s Corporate Governance Following the May Transactions\nBefore June 27, 2014, CEOC’s Board consisted of two employee directors. On that date, one of the directors resigned and six new Board members were appointed, two of which CEC contends were independent directors. The two directors selected independent legal counsel. On July 30, 2014, CEOC’s Board formed a Governance Committee consisting of the two independent directors. These directors, together with the other members of the CEOC Board, approved the August Transaction.\nF. CEOC’s Bankruptcy\nCEOC filed for bankruptcy protection on January 15, 2015. Under the terms of the Indenture, this constituted an “Event of Default” which triggered CEC’s obligations under the Guarantee. Plaintiffs demanded payment on the Guarantee, and CEC refused payment.\nIII. LEGAL STANDARD\nSummary judgment is appropriate where, “viewing the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party ... ‘there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’” “In making this determination ... we resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.” “A fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law, and an issue of fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.”\n“The moving party bears the burden of showing the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact.” To defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must “‘do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts, and may not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation.’”\n“‘The function of the district court in considering the motion for summary judgment is not to resolve disputed questions of fact but only to determine whether, as to any material issue, a genuine factual dispute exists.’” “‘Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge.’”\nIV. APPLICABLE LAW\nA. The Trust Indenture Act\nThe TIA provides that instruments to which it applies must be issued under an indenture that has been qualified by the SEC. The requirements of such indentures are “designed to vindicate a federal policy of protecting investors.”\nSection 316 of the TIA relates to collective action clauses. For example, it is permissible for a majority of noteholders to direct the trustee to exercise its powers under the indenture or for not less than seventy-five percent of noteholders “to consent on behalf of the holders of all such indenture securities to the postponement of any interest payment for a period not exceeding three years from its due date.” Section 316(a)’s terms are permissive— meaning an indenture can expressly exclude such majority action.\nHowever, section 316(b) is mandatory. It states that:\nNotwithstanding any other provision of the indenture to be qualified, the right of any holder of any indenture security to receive payment of the principal of and interest on such indenture security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such indenture security, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder ... ,\nThus, section 316(b) acts to protect a bondholder’s right to receive payment of both principal and interest.\nSection 316(b) addressed earlier practices whereby majority bondholders— often controlled by insiders — used collective or majority action clauses to change the terms of an indenture, to the detriment of minority bondholders. As a result of section 316(b), an issuer cannot — outside of bankruptcy — alter its obligation to pay bondholders without the consent of each bondholder. In this way, section “316(b) was designed to provide judicial scrutiny of debt readjustment plans to ensure their equity.”\n“Congress and the SEC were aware that the holdout problem would frustrate some workouts, but the regulators wanted to impede workouts that took place outside of regulatory and judicial control. The SEC wanted trust indenture legislation that would bring contractual recapitaliza-tions under the jurisdiction of the federal bankruptcy court.” One reason was the concern that, “[b]y buying or otherwise controlling a majority of a distressed company’s bonds[,] ... equity owners could vote to suspend or reduce payments on the bonds, thus allowing value to move down the corporate chain to the equity holders.” This outcome would not be permitted under bankruptcy law. It would be “an inversion of the normal priorities in a corporate bankruptcy by which a company’s debt holders are paid off before the equity holders.”\nB. Contract Interpretation\nUnder New York law, “[t]he court’s function in interpreting a contract is to apply the meaning intended by the parties, as derived from the language of the contract in question.” “[T]he best evidence of what parties to a written agreement intend is what they say in their writing. Thus\' a written agreement that is complete, clear and unambiguous on its face must be enforced according to the plain meaning of its terms.”\n“The question of whether a written contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court.” “Contract language is unambiguous when it has a definite and precise meaning, unattended by danger of misconception in the purport of the contract itself, and concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion.” However, contract language is ambiguous if “the terms of the contract could suggest more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs, practices, usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.” “Evidence outside the four corners of the document as to what was really intended but unstated or misstated is generally inadmissible to add to or vary the writing; evidence as to custom and usage is considered, as needed, to show what the parties’ specialized language is fairly presumed to have .meant.”\nV. DISCUSSION\nSection 1503(3) of the Indenture releases the Guarantee when CEOC ceases to be “wholly owned” by CEC “as such term is defined in Rule l-02(z) of the Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC[].” Under Regulation S-X, a subsidiary is “wholly owned” if “substantially all of [its] outstanding voting shares are owned by its parent and/or the parent’s other wholly owned subsidiaries.”\nCEC argues that the validity of the August Transaction “is irrelevant if the Guarantee was released [under section 1503(3) ] as a result of either or both of the May Transactions.” According to CEC, “[pjlaintiffs have failed to show that CEOC is still ‘wholly owned’ by CEC; at most, whether CEC holds ‘substantially all’ of CEOC’s stock is an issue of fact that cannot be resolved on summary judgment.”\nA. Indenture Section 508 Does Not Bar Release of the Guarantee\nSection 508 of the Indenture states that\nNotwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and ... interest on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.\nThus, section 508 includes the language mandated by section 316(b) of the TIA, but goes further, stating that the right to receive payment of the principal of and interest is “absolute and unconditional.” Applying New York law to a similar provision modifying section 316(b), the Second Circuit has instructed that the absolute and unconditional language should be given effect. The Second Circuit has also interpreted the phrase “notwithstanding any other provision,” explaining that “[t]his Court has recognized many times that under New York law, clauses similar to the phrase ‘[notwithstanding any other provision’ trump conflicting contract terms.”\nRelying on Bank of New York v. First Millennium, Inc., plaintiffs argue that section 508 of the Indenture “ ‘overrides’ any conflicting provisions of the Indenture,” including the Guarantee release provisions. In First Millennium, the FDIC, as receiver for the issuer of certain notes, claimed that it was not liable for the full amount then due on the notes, because a “ ‘limited recourse provision’ of the master indenture limits the funds that the note-holders can pursue for repayment of their notes to those set aside as collateral.” The Second Circuit stated that “[b]y its plain terms, the ‘absolute and unconditional’ right to repayment granted to the note-holders by the indenture overrides the conflicting limited recourse provision, and allows the noteholders to seek repayment from all the assets of the trust.” More specifically, the reason for this conflict was that under New York law, “ ‘an order or promise to pay out of a particular fund is not unconditional.’ ” As a consequence, an absolute and unconditional right to payment “cannot be limited to funds labeled ‘collateral’ in the transaction documents.”\nUnder New York law, a contract should be read to give effect to all of its provisions, and courts should avoid interpretations that render contract terms meaningless or superfluous. In BOKF, I explained that a guarantee release provision does not conflict with a guarantee providing an “absolute and unconditional” right to payment. CEC had argued that the guarantees at issue in that case were not really meant to be guarantees at all, but were simply included for SEC reporting purposes. To support that argument textually, CEC argued that if the guarantees had been unconditional, then the indentures would not have included release provisions. I rejected this argument, explaining that\n[T]he mere fact that CEC could be released from the Guarantee under certain circumstances says little about the nature of the Guarantee itself. That is, simply because a Guarantee may be easily terminated ... does not indicate that the Guarantee was something other than an unconditional guarantee of full and punctual payment when due.\nPlaintiffs attempt to distinguish the import of BOKF — which is that the Guarantee does not conflict with provisions that permit its release. They note that here the “absolute and unconditional” language is not in the Guarantee provision, but in the “notwithstanding provision” of the Indenture.\nHowever, this is a distinction without a difference. Guarantees “must be strictly construed according to their terms” and the “guarantor’s obligation must be narrowly construed and cannot be extended by construction beyond the plain and explicit language of the contract.” Here, the Indenture explicitly permits the removal of the Guarantee under section 1503. Under New York law, when a guarantee is “absolute and unconditional,” this means that it is a guarantee of payment, rather than collection. “As explained more than 13[5] years ago by the New York Court of Appeals:\nThe fundamental distinction between a guaranty of payment and one of collection is, that in the first case the guarantor undertakes unconditionally that the debtor will pay, and the creditor may, upon default, proceed directly against the guarantor, without taking any steps to collect of the principal debtor, and the omission or neglect to proceed against him is not (except under special circumstances) any defense to the guarantor; while in the second case the undertaking is that if the demand cannot be collected by legal proceedings the guarantor will pay, and consequently legal proceedings against the principal debtor, and a failure to collect of him by those means are conditions precedent to the liability of the guarantor .... ”\nThus, CEC’s payment obligation under the Guarantee did not arise until after an event of default, and when it did, plaintiffs had the right to pursue claims directly against CEC under the Guarantee.\nIt follows that had CEC attempted to invoke section 1503(3) to remove the Guarantee after its obligations under the Guarantee were triggered, this would patently violate section 508 (unless CEC received unanimous noteholder consent). But removal of the Guarantee under the terms of section 1503(3) prior to the time the payment obligation under the Guarantee becomes due could violate the terms of section 508 in some contexts, but not in others. Unlike plaintiffs’ interpretation, this reading of the terms of the Indenture gives meaning to each of its terms. It is also consistent with First Millennium and the rule that “under New York law, clauses similar to the phrase Notwithstanding any other provision’ trump conflicting contract terms.” In First Millennium, the nonrecourse provision presented a clear conflict with the absolute and unconditional right to payment under the facts of that case — the notes at issue were due and owing, the noteholders had not been paid in full, and the FDIC was attempting to limit recovery “out of a particular fund.”\nIn sum, plaintiffs’ interpretation of section 508 fails to give appropriate meaning to the terms of the Guarantee and the provisions that permit the release of that Guarantee. In addition — and in contrast to the cases cited by plaintiffs — plaintiffs have not shown that there is a conflict between sections 508 and 1503(3).\nB. CEC Is Not Precluded from Asserting’ that the May Transactions Released the Guarantee\nPlaintiffs contend that CEC is barred from relying on the May Transactions based on the law of judicial admissions and judicial estoppel. According to plaintiffs, CEC has taken the contrary position — i.e., that the May Transactions did not release the Guarantee — in related lawsuits brought by BOKF, N.A. and UMB Bank, N.A. to enforce CEC’s guarantees of different notes. For _ example, CEC stated in its brief opposing BOKF’s motion for partial summary judgment that:\nAs a consequence of the August [] Transaction, the Guarantee was released under the last paragraph of Section 12.02(c) of the [Second Lien] Indenture. That is because the transaction provided an independent basis for the release of CEC’s guarantee of the 2016 and 2017 Notes, which were the last outstanding “Existing Notes” defined in the indenture, as CEC’s guarantee of the other “Existing Notes” had already been discharged or released.\nIn addition, “David Sambur, an Apollo partner who serves on CEC’s Board and testified as CEC’s Rule 30(b)(6) witness in this action, made a nearly identical statement in a sworn declaration CEC submitted with its opposition papers.” However, these statements do not support preclusion under either the law of judicial admissions or judicial estoppel.\nThe statements are not judicial admissions because they concern the legal effect of certain transactions, and only statements of fact can be binding judicial admissions. Moreover, the statements do not unequivocally state that CEC believed that the May Transactions were insufficient to release the Guarantee.\nBoth before and after this litigation, CEC’s position has been that the August Transaction ‘“provided an independent basis’ for releasing the Guarantee on the 2016 Notes.” After the 5% Stock Sale, CEC filed an SEC Form 8-K reporting that its “guarantee of CEOC’s outstanding secured and unsecured notes was automatically released.” Likewise, CEC explained in its opposition to BOKF’s motion for partial summary judgment that:\nOn May 6, 2014, CEC and CEOC announced a transaction (the “B-7 Transaction”) designed to repay CEOC’s near-term maturities. Under the B-7 Transaction, CEOC obtained $1.75 billion of new term loans, which were used to repay, among other things, nearly all outstanding notes that were set to mature before 2016. As a condition of the new financing, however, the lenders who negotiated the transaction demanded that CEC exercise its right under various indentures — including the BOKF and UMB Indentures — to release CEC’s parent guarantee. Because of the benefits to CEOC of obtaining the new loans, CEC and CEOC assented to the lenders’ conditions. Accordingly, on May 5, 2014, CEC sold 5% of CEOC’s stock to three unaffiliated investors for a total of $6.15 million. The sale did not modify the Indenture, and the Indenture did not require any consent by the BOKF (or UMB) Holders. As a consequence of the sale, CEOC was no longer a “Wholly Owned Subsidiary” of CEC, and the Guarantee was released. Following this transaction, under Rule 3-10 and the Indenture, CEOC began to file its own audited financial statements with the SEC.\nOn the day of the August Transaction, CEC filed a Form 8-K stating the Guarantee had been released following the 5% Stock Sale, and also “notfing] that CEOC had provided additional notices to the trustees for outstanding secured notes reaffirming its position [as stated in earlier notices based in part on the 5% Stock Sale] that CEC’s guarantee had been released as a result of the guarantee of CEOC’s unsecured notes being released.” On the basis of these statements and the overall context, plaintiffs fail to show that CEC has taken inconsistent positions in describing the effect of the May Transactions.\nPlaintiffs’ arguments regarding judicial estoppel also lack merit. “ ‘A party invoking judicial estoppel must show that (1) the party\' against whom the estop-pel is asserted took an inconsistent position in a prior proceeding and (2) that position was adopted by the first tribunal in some manner, such as by rendering a favorable judgment.’ ” However, as just described, the relevant statements are not unequivocally inconsistent. Accordingly, CEC’s argument based on the May Transactions is not barred by the doctrines of judicial admission or judicial estoppel.\nC. There Is a Genuine Dispute of Material Fact as to Whether CEOC Was Wholly Owned by CEC Following the May Transactions\nSection 1503 of the Indenture states that “[CEC] shall be released from all of its obligations under the Guarantee” if, among other things, CEOC “ceases for any reason to be a ‘wholly owned subsidiary’ of [CEC] (as such term is defined in Rule l-02(z) of the Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC).” Regulation S-X sets forth. accounting rules and requirements for financial statements filed under the federal securities laws. Under Regulation S-X, a subsidiary is “wholly owned” if “substantially all of [its] outstanding voting shares are owned by its parent and/or the parent’s other wholly owned subsidiaries.” “Voting shares” are defined to mean “the sum of all rights, other than as affected by events of default, to vote for election of directors and/or the sum of all interests in an unincorporated person.”\nThe parties agree that following the 5% Stock Sale, CEC owned roughly 95% of CEOC’s common shares, and that following the PIP, CEC owned roughly 89%. Plaintiffs argue that 89% ownership “falls within the plain meaning of ‘substantially all,’” and then direct the Court to guidance issued by SEC Staff interpreting Regulation S-X. CEC argues that the guidance is irrelevant because it has “nothing to do with guarantees of public debt, but the unrelated issue of ‘push-down accounting,’ the principles governing the financial .statements of target companies in certain circumstances following an acquisition.” But the Indenture makes the applicable section of Regulation S-X relevant by referencing it in section 1503(3).\nPlaintiffs rely heavily on the quantitative measures set forth in EITF D-97. According to that document:\nIn determining whether a company has become substantially wholly owned, the SEC staff has stated that push-down accounting would be required if 95 percent or more of the company has been acquired (unless the company has outstanding public debt or preferred stock that may impact the acquirer’s ability to control the form of ownership of the company), permitted if 80 percent to 95 percent has been acquired, and prohibited if less than 80 percent of the company is acquired.\nPutting aside that this Staff guidance refers to “substantially wholly owned” and not “wholly owned,” it is unclear from the above why push-down accounting is \'permitted, but not required, at the 80% to 95% level.\nMoreover, plaintiffs fail to establish the qualitative factors discussed in the SEC Staff guidance. Plaintiffs argue that CEC continued to control 100% of the shares that vote for the election of directors because (i) CEOC’s Certifícate of Incorporation permits directors to appoint directors to fill vacancies, and (ii) the new Board was elected on June 27, 2014 through that process. Plaintiffs likewise claim that the ‘“form of ownership[]’ of CEOC remained in CEC’s control” following the May Transactions because the minority shareholders did not vote for the new directors in June 2014.\nHowever, if the directors were elected pursuant to the provision in \'the Certificate of Incorporation that allows directors to fill vacancies, then the failure of the minority shareholders to vote is irrelevant. Filling vacancies in this way is not done through voting shares. For this reason, Delaware law contemplates that while vacancies can be filled by the Board, annual elections must be held at which Board members can be removed for any reason.\nPlaintiffs also argue that “CEC’s 89% voting interest in CEOC has enabled CEC to dominate CEOC completely, dictating all aspects of CEOC’s existence, including day-to-day operations as well as extraordinary actions such as asset sales, related-party transactions, and CEOC’s bankruptcy filing.” Not one of these examples relates directly to voting shares or Board elections. To the extent that they relate to controlling the “form of ownership,” at all, they do so based on the premise that CEC controls CEOC’s Board. However,\ndetermining whether CEC “controls” CEOC requires consideration of fact specific issues — including the expansion of CEOC’s Board in June 2014, the addition of independent CEOC directors, the creation of a CEOC Board Governance Committee in July 2014 (comprising those independent directors) that was empowered to evaluate material financial transactions and those that might have involved a material conflict with CEC, and the retention of independent legal and financial advisors to investigate potential claims by CEOC against CEC.\nIn other words, there are genuine disputes of material fact that preclude summary judgment.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nBecause there are genuine disputes of material fact as to whether the May Transactions independently released the Guarantee, I do not address whether the August Transaction violated the terms of either the TIA or the Indenture. For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs’ motions are DENIED. The Clerk of the Court is directed to close these motions [Dkt. Nos: 67 and 74 in No. 14-cv-7091 and Dkt.

However, plaintiffs have not provided a plain meaning analysis.\n. CEC Opp. at 14. As discussed in the following footnote, there is, in fact, Staff guidance on reporting requirements relating to parent guarantors.\n. While the guidance is not “irrelevant,” it is certainly confusing. Both EITF D-97 and SAB 112 refer to the concept of “substantially wholly owned.” But neither Regulation S-X nor the Indenture use the term ""substantially wholly owned.” Rather, the question under Regulation S-X and the Indenture is whether, for purposes of determining whether CEOC is a wholly owned subsidiary, CEC owns substantially all of the voting shares of CEOC. The concept of ""substantially wholly owned” makes even less sense when one considers another provision of Regulation S-X — Rule 3-10. That provision deals explicitly with parent guarantees. Rather than borrow the definition of ""wholly owned subsidiary” from Rule 2-10, it uses the concept of a ""100% owned subsidiary,” which is met when ""all of [the subsidiary’s] outstanding voting shares are owned, either directly or indirectly, by its parent company.” 17 C.F.R. § 210.3-10(h)(1). The SEC has explained why “100% owned” is used in Rule 3-10:\nUnder [Staff Accounting Bulletin] 53, a subsidiary was ’wholly owned\' if all of its outstanding voting shares and any outstanding securities convertible into its voting shares were owned, either directly or indirectly, by its parent company. This meaning differs from the general definition of \'wholly-owned subsidiary\' in Rule l-02(aa) of Regulation S-X. Rule l-02(aa) treats a subsidiary as wholly owned if substantially all of its voting shares are held by its parent company. We proposed that the meaning of ""wholly owned” for the purposes of Rule 3-10 would be, in large part, the same as the staff’s analysis under SAB 53.\nSEC Release Notice, Release No. 55 (2000).\n.

Wake, United States District Judge\nBefore the Court is Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 56) and the parties’ accompanying statements of facts and briefs. For the, reasons that follow, the Motion will be granted.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nSt. Luke’s Behavioral Hospital, LP (“St. Luke’s”) is a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona. It is owned and operated by IASIS Healthcare Corporation, the sole merhber of IASIS Healthcare, LLC (collectively “IASIS”).\nSt. Luke’s hired John Fleming in 2000 and fired him in 2012. Fleming claims his termination was illegally motivated by one or more of the following considerations: his sex, religion, age, disability, and statutorily protected activity. He also' claims that, even if his termination was lawful, his employment contract entitles him to compensation for unused, “paid time off” hours.\nSt. Luke’s and IASIS (collectively “Defendants”), move for summary judgment on all these claims. They, contend Fleming was fired due to his poor performance and that he is not contractually entitled to any additional compensation.\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nA motion for summary judgment -tests whether the opposing party has sufficient evidence to merit a trial. Summary judgment should be granted if the evidence reveals no genuine dispute about any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A material fact is one that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law, and a factual dispute is genuine “if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).\nThe movant has the burden of showing the absence of genuine disputes of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). However, once the movant shows an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case, the burden shifts to the party resisting the motion. The party opposing summary judgment must thén “set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial” and may not rest upon the pleadings. Anderson, ill U.S. at 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505. To carry this burden, the nonmoving party must do more than simply show-there is “some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.” Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538(1986).\nIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, must not weigh the evidence or assess its- credibility, and must draw all justifiable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505. Where the record) taken as a whole, could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for trial. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348.\nIII. MATERIAL FACTS\nThe following facts áre drawn from the undisputed portions of Defendants’ statement of facts ’ (Doc. 57), Fleming’s statement of facts (Doc. 61), and parts of the record identified in the parties’ briefs. All evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Fleming.\nA. Evidence Relating to Whether Fleming, was Illegally Terminated\n- Fleming claims he was fired because of his sex, religion, age, and disability, and in retaliation for engaging in statutorily protected activity. Defendants contend Fleming was fired due to poor performance. Evidence relating to these claims is described below.\n1. Performance History\nIn 2000, St. Luke’s hired Fleming as a Therapist. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 17.) In 2005, Fleming began working in St. Luke’s Intake and Assessment Department. (Id. at ¶ 18.) He received annual performance-based raises. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 153.) He was good with patients and good at responding to crises, and patients liked him. (Id. at ¶ 200.) But there were problems.\nIn 2005, a supervisor reprimanded Fleming for (1) failing, to follow proper procedures for contacting physicians on call, (2) improperly filling out' a doctor rotation sheet, (3) improperly assigning patients to beds, and (4) admitting a patient under the wrong insurance. (Doc. 57 at ¶¶ 21, 24, 26.) According to - the annual Performance Evaluation, Fleming was “struggling” with some of the patient intake processes and was “struggling” to complete patient assessments in a timely manner. (Id. at ¶ 29.)-However, the Evaluation also: included positive comments and concluded that Fleming “meets standards” overall. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 28.)\nIn 2006, a supervisor, reprimanded Fleming for improper and untimely submissions of work hours, (Doc. 57 at ¶ 33.) The supervisor also instructed him.to expedite the patient admissions process and to learn more about the “pre-certification” process of obtaining an insurance compar ny^ approval for treatment. (Id., at ¶¶ 35, 37.) According to the annual Performance Evaluation, Fleming needed to “expedite” the. patient admissions process, be “more thorough,” and show “more consistency.” (Id. at ¶ 39.) However, the Evaluation also includéd positive comments and concluded that Fleming “meets standards” overall. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 39.)\nIn 2007, supervisors reprimanded Fleming for (1) failing to complete patient evaluations, (2) failing to follow the behavioral health certification process,. (3) failing to document a call from a patient in crisis, (4) excessive unplanned absences, (5) inappropriate use of evaluation and treatment waivers, and (6) poor clinical judgment. (Doc. 57 at ¶¶ 42, 45, 47, 51, 54.) Fleming did not deny that his actions put a patient at risk. (Id. at ¶ 52.) A supervisor warned him that he should consider other employment options if he continues to make poor patient evaluations, (id. at ¶ 56.) According to the annual Performance Evaluation, Fleming needed improvement in “organization,” “time,” “documentation,” and number of “errors.\"" (Id. at ¶ 59.) However, the Evaluation also included positive comments and concluded that Fleming “Meets the Standard” in most areas. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 58.)\nIn 2008, a supervisor reprimanded Fleming for failing to pursue an appropriate treatment plan, thereby putting .a potentially suicidal patient at risk. ,(Doc. 57 .at ¶ 61.) The supervisor warned him that if he puts one more patient at risk, “the possibility of termination will be pursued.” (Id.) Weeks later, the supervisor also reprimanded Fleming for (1) failing to complete a- mandatory patient evaluation and. (2) failing to contact a .physician before transferring a patient.. (Id. at ¶¶ 64, 67.). The supervisor warned him that any further disciplinary actions “could result in termination.” (Id. at ¶ 67.) Later that year, supervisors reprimanded Fleming for.(l) disregarding instructions about admitting a patient, (2) excessive non-business Internet use, and (3) reeking of alcohol while at work. (Id. at ¶¶ 71, 75, 82.) According to the annual Performance Evaluation, Fleming needed to “follow the designated process” and “expedite” patient admissions. (Id. at ¶ 73.) However, the Evaluation also included positive comments and concluded that Fleming “meets standards” overall. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 73.)\nIn 2009, supervisors reprimanded Fleming for (1) failing to complete a patient evaluation, (2) taking a smoke break during a patient’s disposition, (3) excessive tardiness, (4) failing to complete the required number of patient assessments per shift, and (5) incorrectly filling out a “duty to warn” form., (Doc. 57 at ¶¶ 83, 86, 89.) According to -the annual Performance Evaluation, Fleming needed improvement in “expediting” the patient assessment process. (Id. at ¶ 91.) However, the Evaluation also included positive comments and concluded that Fleming “Meets the Standard” or “Exceeds the Standard” overall. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 91.)\nIn 2010, a supervisor reprimanded Fleming for his poor judgment and incomplete work with respect to patient care. (Doc. 57 at ¶'95.) The supervisor warned him: “This is the final conference. Any further disciplinary action' will result in termination.”- (Id.) Weeks later, the supervisor reprimanded Fleming for excessive unapproved absences. (Id. at ¶ 98.)- The supervisor warned him that another unexcused absence “will set in motion the final steps in the disciplinary process leading to termination.” (Id.) Later that' year, the same supervisor reprimanded Fleming for (1) failing to follow up with discharged patients and (2) writing the'wrong doctor’s name on an admission document. (Id. at ¶¶ 100, 102, 103.) Then a new supervisor, Julie Miller, filled out Fleming’s annual Performance Evaluation. (See id. at ¶ 105.) Miller noted that Fleming needed to do “more” patient admissions and needed to do patient pre-certifications “quickly.” (Id.) However, she also, included positive comments and concluded that Fleming “Meets the Standard’.’ or “Exceeds the Standard” overall. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 105.)\n■ In 2011, Miller reprimanded Fleming for (1) telling a patient no hospital beds were available instead of offering an assessment, (2) failing to perform pre-certifications and instead leaving them for the next shift, (3) tardiness, (4) failing to follow up .with discharged patients, (5) saying that he called Miller for a consultation when in fact he did.not, (6) saying that he checked his email .for an important message when in fact he did not,' and (7) failing to write down information , given to a patient. (Doc. 57 at ¶¶ 107, 109, 111.) In the annual Performance Evaluation, Miller noted that Fleming needed to “maintain productivity” and “improve consistency.” (Id. at ¶ 112.) However, she also included positive comments and concluded that Fleming “meets standards” overall. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 112.) .\nThe month leading up to Fleming’s termination was eventful. In' a Performance Evaluation dated September 4, 2012, Miller noted that Fleming’s; “documentation has been lacking information and he has had many incomplete forms” and that “he could work on doing a faster assessment/admit process and be more consistent with his work.” (Doc. 57 at ¶ 116.) She also included positive comments and concluded that Fleming “meets 'standards” overall. (See Doc. 61 at ¶ 153.) On September 10, Miller gave Fleming a final written warning for (1) sending improper docu-inentation to family members of two different patients, (2) seeing a patient for whom he\"" failed to complete an authorization form, and .(3) failing to complete a patient assessment. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 121.) On September 13, Miller reprimanded, Fleming for failing to use a cover sheet when faxing a patient’s protected health information, in violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HI-PAA”). (I'd at ¶ 118.) ■\nThe incident immediately preceding Fleming’s termination occurred oh September 25, 2012. Fleming assigned a 12-year-old patient to an overcapacity bed without completing the necessary procedures. (Id. at ¶¶ 130-40.) Fleming left the task of completing the overcapacity procedures for the next shift, telling his coworker Alisa Furch: “I’m not going to stay a moment longer, you can do it.” (Id. at ¶ 141.) Fleming could not stay longer because he was experiencing tremendous back pain and had lost feeling in his writing hand. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 138.) Fleming had already stayed at work longer than scheduled, and he thought completing the overcapacity procedures would be complicated and time consuming and would preclude the patient from receiving treatment.- (Id!) He had the authority to delegate the task to Furch. (Id. at ¶ 190.) When Miller-heard about this incident, however, she believed Fleming should have completed the overcapacity procedures himself because the patient was Fleming’s responsibility. (Doc. 57 at ¶¶ 142-45.)\nThe Human Resources Director, Amy Howell, recommended that Miller suspend Fleming and investigate the incident. (Id. at ¶¶120, 148.) Accordingly, Miller suspended Fleming. (Id. at ¶ 149.) Fleming had never been suspended before. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 153.) Miller then spoke with Furch and two other employees and reviewed patient documentation to determine whether Fleming had followed proper procedure. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 150.) She did not speak with Fleming during her investigation. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 192.) After the investigation, Miller and Howell concluded Fleming should be terminated. (Doc. 57 at ¶¶ 151-52.) Fleming’s prior disciplinary history played a role in their decision, according to later statements. (Id. at ¶ 153.) Howell then contacted the IASIS Vice President of Human Resources to explain the situation, discuss Fleming’s disciplinary history, and request authorization to terminate. (Id. at ¶ 154.) On October 1, Fleming met with Miller, Howell, and another St. Luke’s employee named Jennifer Govan.'(Id. at ¶ 156; Doc. 57-1 at 78.) He Was told he was being terminated for failing to follow proper procedure while oh a final warning. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 156.)\n2. Sex Discrimination\nFleming believes many of the complaints that led to his reprimands targeted him because he was male. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 173.) When' Fleming requested time off, female employees with ’less seniority were given time off, but Fleming was not. (Id. at ¶ 175.) On one occasion, female employees with less s'eniority were allowed to attend an employee awards ceremony, but Fleming was not. (Id. at ¶ 176.) When-Fleming requested a preferred workstation due to his back pain and his role as a lead therapist, his request was- denied, and a female employee with less seniority used the workstation instead. (Id. at ¶ 197.)\nFleming'was also treated differently from two female employees who were involved in the September 25 incident preceding his termination. Furch, like Fleming, did not complete the overcapacity procedures. (Id. at ¶ 190.) And Kathy Bouise did not reserve a, bed that would have prevented the need for overcapacity procedures in the first place. (Id. at ¶ 185.) Neither was disciplined. (Id. at ¶ 184.) In addition, other employees in “the unit” who failed to take appropriate action were not disciplined. (Id. at ¶¶ 184, 186-87.)\nNó one ever told Fleming he was fired because of his gender. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 158.) He néver heard Miller make any negative comments about his gehder. (Id. at ¶ 164.) No other 'evidence relating to sex discrimination is identified in the parties’ statements of facts or briefs.\n‘3. Religious Discrimination\nFleming is Catholic. Fleming believes many of the complaints that led to his reprimands targeted him because he was more religious than other employees. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 173.) Miller once said she would not go to a Catholic church. (Doc. 57-1 at 94-95.) Govan said the Catholic Church was a “sick religion” and talked about priests and defiling young boys. (Id. at 96.)\nGovan was not involved, in the decision to fire Fleming. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 155.) No other evidence relating to religious discrimination , is identified in the • parties’ statements of facts or briefs.\n4.Age Discrimination\nFleming is sixty years old. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 16.) He believes many of the complaints that led to his reprimands targeted 'him because 'he was older than other employees. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 173.)\nNo one ever told him Fleming he was fired because of his age. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 159.) He never heard Miller make any negative comments about his age. (Id. at.li 163.) No other evidence relating to age discrimination is identified in the parties’ statements of facts or briefs.\n5.Disability Discrimination\nFleming developed carpal tunnel syndrome and back problems. (Doc. 57-1 at 93.) Miller and another supervisor knew about Fleming’s back problems and reliance on pain medication. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 194.) Fleming requested a more convenient workstation due to his back pain. (Id. at ¶ 197.) He did. not provide Miller with a doctor’s note stating his need for the workstation. (Doc. 57-1 at 103.) Miller denied his request. (Doc. 61 at ¶¶ 196-97.) Fleming felt that his supervisors perceived his disabilities as inhibiting his performance, and he was not allowed to perform the same tasks as female employees. (Id. at ¶ 201.)\nNo one ever told Fleming he was fired because of his medical conditions. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 160.) He never heard Miller make any negative comments about his medical conditions. (Id. at 11.165.) No other evidence relating to disability discrimination is identified in the parties’ statements of facts or briefs.\n6.Retaliation\nFleming claims he was fired in retaliation for complaining about co-workers’ behavior and for requesting leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLÁ”). Evidence relating to these claims is described below.\na. Complaint about coworkers’ behavior\nApproximately three years before he Was fired, Fleming complained to -Miller that co-workers were making inappropriate comments involving, age, sex, arid religion. (Doc. 57-1 at 104-05.)\nNo one ever told Fleming he was fired because he complained about co-workers. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 162.) No other evidence relating to this retaliation claim is identified in the parties’ statements of facts or briefs,\nb. Request for FMLA leave\nOn September 11, 2012, Fleming told Miller he intended to take FMLA leave to. receive surgery on his hand and pain management for his spine. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 198.) Miller directed Fleming to the Human Resources Department, where he received FMLA paperwork. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 127.) He submitted this paperwork and received a letter from Human Resources on September 18 confirming receipt of his request. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 198.) He was then suspended on September 26 and fired on October 1, (Doc. 57 at ¶¶ 130, 149, 156; Doc. 57-1 at 78.)\nNo one ever told Fleming he was fired because he requested FMLA leave. (Doc\""; 57 at ¶ 161.) No other evidence relating to this retaliation claim is identified in the parties’ statements of facts or briefs.\nB. Evidence Relating to Whether Fleming is Contractually Entitled to Additional Compensation i\nFleming also claims that, even if his termination was lawful, his employment contract entitles him to compensation for unused “paid time off’ hours. Fleming relies on a clause in the IASIS Employee Handbook. On page 26, the Handbook states:\nUnused PTO [paid time off] accrual may be cashed out at full value... at the time of termination or retirement provided the employee has been employed at least ninety (90) days. ■ -\n(Doc. 61 at ¶ 199.) Fleming received a copy of the Handbook in 2007. (Doe, 57' at ¶ 13.)\nDefendants contend a differerit clause in the Handbook precludes Fleming’s claim because he was' fired. Ori page 25, the Handbook states:\n[A]ny employee who... is involuntarily terminated for any reason other than a reduction-in-force or layoff due to lack of work.. .will not be paid for any unused PTO [paid time off] upon termination of employment_\n(Id. at ¶ 12.) Fleming was involuntarily terminated for a reason other than a reduction-in-force or layoff due to lack of work. (Id. at ¶ 169.) \""•\nIV. ANALYSIS\nFleming claims his termination constituted unlawful discrimination, retaliation, and breach of contract. Each claim is considered in turn. . - •\nA. Discrimination,\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (“Title VII”),' prohibits an employer from discriminating against an individual because of the individual’s “sex” or “religion,” among other factors. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(l). The Age Discrimination-in Employment Act of 1967, as amended (“ADEA”), prohibits an employer from discriminating against an individual because of the individual’s “age.” 29 U.S.C. §. 623(a)(1). The Americans, with Disabilities- Act (“ADA”) prohibits an employer from discriminating against a qualified individual . “on the basis -. of. disability.” 42 U.S.C. §. 12112(a). Fleming claims his termination violated all three statutory prohibitions. He offers no direct evidence -of discriminatory intent; rather, he relies on circumstantial evidence.\nFleming’s discrimination claims all proceed under the McDonnell Douglas three-step burden-shifting framework: (1) Fleming must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination; (2) if he does, Defendants must then articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its conduct; and (3) if they do, Fleming must then demonstrate that the articulated reason is a pretext for discrimination. Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 888-89 (9th Cir. 1994) (applying framework to Title VII and ADEA claims); see also Snead v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1093 (9th Cir.2001) (applying framework to ADA claim).\n1. Prima facie case\nTo state a prima facie case of Title VII discrimination, Fleming must show that (1) he belongs to a protected class, (2) he was performing his job satisfactorily, (3) he suffered an adverse employment action, and (4) he was treated less favorably than other employees with similar qualifications. Vasquez v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 349 F.3d 634, 640 n. 5 (9th Cir.2003). Similarly, to state a prima facie case of ADEA discrimination, Fleming must show that (1) he belongs to a protected class/ (2) he was performing his job satisfactorily, (3) he. suffered’ an adverse employment action, and (4) he was replaced by substantially younger employees with similar qualifications. Coleman v. Quaker Oats Co., 232 F.3d 1271, 1281 (9th Cir.2000). Finally, to state a prima facie case of ADA discrimination, Fleming'must show that (1) he is a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA, (2) he was able to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation, and (3) he suffered an adverse employment action because of his disability. Allen v. Pac. Bell, 348 F.3d 1113, 1114 (9th Cir.2003). In each case the requisite degree of proof is “minimal,” and Fleming “need only offer evidence which gives rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.” Wallis, 26 F.3d at 889 (in context of Title VII. and ADEA claims); see also Kinney v. Emmis Operation Co., 291 Fed.Appx. 789, 790 (9th Cir.2007) (applying same standard to ADA claim).\nIt is doubtful whether Fléming has established a prima facie case of any discrimination. His termination occurred shortly after he violated company policy multiple times while on final warning. See Diaz v. Eagle Produce Ltd. P’ship, 521 F.3d 1201, 1208 (9th Cir.2008) (affirming lack of ADEA prima facie case where employee “over an extended period openly violated [company policy] and continued to do so even after receiving a warning”). And his disciplinary history appears to be unparalleled among his co-workers. See Leong v. Potter, 347 F.3d 1117, 1124 (9th Cir.2003) (affirming lack of Title VII prima facie casé where plaintiff was the only employee subject to a “Last Chance Agreement” and had unmatched “record of misconduct”).\nNevertheless, given the low threshold required at this first step of the McDonnell Douglas framework, the Court assumes without, deciding that Fleming has established a prima facie case. See Coleman, 232 F.3d at 1282 (taking this approach).\n2. Legitimate nondiscriminatory reason\nThe-burden now shifts to Defendants to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for firing Fleming. Defendants have articulated two such reasons: (1) Fleming violated company policy on September 25, 2012, after receiving a final warning, and (2) Fleming had also violated company policy many times before then. Defendants have met their burden of production.\n3. Pretext\nThe burden now shifts back to Fleming to demonstrate that these articulated reasons are merely a pretext for discriminátion. The evidentiary threshold is higher at this step than at the prima facie case, as Fleming must produce “specific, Substantial evidence” of pretext. Wallis, 26 F.3d at 890 (in context of Title VII and ADEA claims); see also Snead, 237 F.3d at 1094 (finding evidence insufficient to show pretext even though it was sufficient for ADA prima facie case). In an attempt to refute Defendants’ articulated reasons for firing him, Fleming offers evidence of two types.\n. First, Fleming offers evidence that his job performance was satisfactory overall. He relies on the annual. Performance Evaluations, which generally placed him in the “meets expectations” category. But this categorization, in light of the dozens of reprimands Fleming earned over the years, seems little more than a conclusion that the evaluator was not ready to recommend termination yet. Fleming attempts to characterize his reprimands as' evidence of discrimination, but that characterization is untenable because he does not dispute most of the' underlying facts leading up to the reprimands.\nAnd even if the “meets expectations” label is meaningful, it is not evidence of satisfactory performance in the most relevant timeframe. The last Evaluation was made on September 4, 2012. That Evaluation could not have anticipated that on September 10 Fleming would receive a final written warning for improper and incomplete' documentation, that on September 13 he would fax confidential patient information in violation of HIPAA, or that on September 25 he- would fail- to complete a mandatory procedural task and would leave it for the next shift. These incidents alone constitute a legitimate h'on-discriminatory reason for termination which is not impugned by Fleming’s performance-related evidence.\nSecond, Fleming offers evidence downplaying the significance of his violations of company policy. In his affidavit, he declares that'his actions on September 25 were justified under the circumstances, that other employees were also partially responsible fdr the September 25 incident, and that his prior infractions were too minor, infrequent, and remote in time to call for termination. But this evidence misses the mark. “The focus of a pretext inquiry is whether the employer’s stated reason was honest, not whether it was accurate, wise, or well-cónsidered.” Green v. Maricopa Cty. Cmty. Coll. Sch. Dist., 265 F.Supp.2d 1110, 1128 (D.Ariz.2003) (citation omitted). Fleming’s evidence goes primarily to the wisdom of Defendants’ termination decision, not its sincerity. This evidence does not indicate dishonesty, and it is dwarfed by the well-documented and largely undisputed evidence of Fleming’s lengthy disciplinary history.\nIn sum, Fleming has not produced specific, substantial evidence of pretext. The record, taken as a whole, could not lead a rational trier) of fact to find for Fleming with respect to his discrimination claims.\nB. Retaliation\nFleming also claims he was terminated in retaliation for complaining about coworkers’ inappropriate behavior and for requesting FMLA leave.\n1.. Complaint about, co- . workers’ behavior\nTitle VII, the ADEA, and the ADA all prohibit an employer from retaliating against an employee for engaging in protected activity. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a) (Title VII); 29 U.S.C. § 623(d) (ADEA); 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a) (ADA). Fleming claims he was fired -in retaliation for engaging in the protected activity of complaining about co-workers’ inappropriate comments involving age, sex, and religion.\nThese retaliation claims proceed under the familiar McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework: (1) Fleming must first establish a prima facie case; (2) Defendants must then articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its conduct; and (3) Fleming must then demonstrate pretext. Pardi v. Kaiser Found. Hosp., 389 F.3d 840, 849 (9th Cir.2004) (ADA retaliation claim); Hashimoto v. Dalton, 118 F.3d 671, 680 (9th Cir.1997) (Title. VII retaliation claim); see also Merrick v. Farmers Ins., 892 F.2d 1434, 1441 (9th Cir.1990) (applying Title Vil discrimination case law to ADEA retaliation case). To establish a prima facie case, Fleming must show that (1) he engaged in a protected activity, (2) he suffered an adverse employment decision, and (3) there was a causal link between the two. Pardi, 389 F.3d at. 849; Hashimoto, 118 F.3d at 679; see also O’Day v. McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co., 79 F.3d 756, 763 (9th Cir.1996) (ADEA retaliation claim).\nFleming has not shown a causal link between his complaint about co-workers and his termination. Fleming’s only evidence of causation is that his termination occurred after his complaint. The problem is the three years in between. While temporal proximity between protected activity and adversé employment action may suggest a causal link in some cases, adverse action taken three years afterward “suggests, by itself, no causality at all.” Clark Cty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 274, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001).\n2. Request for FMLA leave\nThe FMLA gives .employees the right to take leave for- certain reasons. 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a). The FMLA also prohibits employers from interfering with the exercise or attempted exercise of this right. 29 U.S.C. §-2615(a)(1). As a result, “employers cannot use the taking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions.” Bachelder v. Am. W. Airlines, Inc., 259 F.3d 1112, 1122 (9th Cir.2001) (alteration and emphasis omitted) [quoting 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c)). Fleming claims Defendants used his request for FMLA leave as a negative factor in deciding to fire him.\nThis claim does not proceed under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Xin Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F.3d 1125, 1136 (9th Cir.2003). Instead, the claim will survive' summary judgment if there is a triable issue of material fact as to whether Fleming’s FMLA leave request was impermissibly considered as a factor in his termination. Id. Here, there is no such triable issue.\nFleming’s theory is that, because he was fired two weeks after requesting leave, the “timing of the request and the termination alone create an issue of triable fact here.” (Doc. 60 at 13.) In support of this theory, he selectively cites portions of opinions by the First, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits. None of these opinions actually supports his theory, and in fact the first two contradict it.\nFleming quotes a First Circuit opinion for the proposition that “close temporal proximity between two events may give rise to an inference of causal, connection.” (Doc. 60 at 13 (quoting Hodgens v. General Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 168 (1st Gir.1998)).) He refers to this quoted statement as a “holding.” (Id.). Far from it. The Hodgens. court affirmed summary judgment against the plaintiff employee. 144 F.3d at 173. -And the facts there were, if anything, more plaintiff-friendly. Not only had the employee been fired “shortly after” taking ;FMLA leave, but he also had a “good work history” for three of the five preceding years and his supervisor had recently complained about his “excessive absences.” Id. at 170. By contrast, Fleming had a checkered work history for all seven years preceding his termination, and-his supervisor helped him request FMLA leave by, directing him to Human Resources for the appropriate paperwork. If summary judgment was justified in’ Hod-gens, it is justified here.\nFleming also relies on a Sixth Circuit opinion for the proposition that “close temporal proximity between FMLA leave and termination may be sufficient to meet the low threshold of proof necessary to establish a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge.” (Doc. 60 at 13 (citing Seeger v. Cincinnati Bell Tel. Co., LLC, 681 F.3d 274, 283 (6th Cir.2012)).) It is true that the Seeger court held temporal proximity sufficient for a prima facie case of retaliation. 681 F.3d at 284. -But that holding is irrelevant. The prima facie case is part of the McDonnell Douglas framework, which the Ninth Circuit does not apply to FMLA retaliation claims. Liu, 347 F.3d at 1136. And even under this framework, Fleming would flunk the third step of demonstrating pretext. As the Seeger court recognized, Sixth Circuit precedent is clear that “temporal proximity cannot be the sole basis for finding pretext.” 681 F.3d at 285 (quoting Donald v. Sybra, Inc., 667 F.3d 757, 763 (6th Cir 2012)). The Seeger court, like the Hodgens court, affirmed summary judgment against the plaintiff employee, despite his prima facie case. Id. at 287.\nFinally, Fleming relies most heavily on a Ninth Circuit opinion, which he quotes for the proposition that the temporal proximity between his leave request and termination “provides supporting evidence of a connection between the two events.” (Doc. 60 at 13 (quoting Liu, 347 F.3d at 1137).) The key word there is “supporting.” Although the Liu court reversed summary judgment against a plaintiff who had been terminated after taking leave, 347 F.3d at 1137, the timing of the termination played only a “supporting” role in the court’s opinion. The court first noted that the decision to fire the plaintiff was based largely on her supervisor’s “subjective evaluation,” which gave the plaintiff low scores in “vague” categories such as “being upbeat.” Id. at ,1136-37. The court also noted, a suspiciously steep drop in overall score from.the plaintiffs former evaluation. Id. In addition, the court found that the supervisor’s behavior toward the plaintiff — namely, his “repeated denials of her leave and comments about his increased work-load” — suggested a negative attitude toward her taking leave. Id. Only after discussing all. this evidence did the court state “the proximity in time between the leave and her termination also provides supporting evidence of a connection between the two events.” Id. Therefore, the only thing Liu established about the timing of termination is that it can support, a retaliation claim for which there is already offier evidence. It did not hold that timing alone creates a triable issue of fact. Indeed, such a rule would place employers in a dilemma as to any unsatisfactory employee who requests leave: either keep him or face trial. The FMLA does not impose this Hobson’s choice.\nHaving rejected Fleming’s “timing is enough” theory, the Court returns to the broader question: is there- a triable issue as to whether Defendants considered Fleming’s leave request in deciding to fire him? The answer is no. The record is replete with instances of Fleming’s violations of company policy. As a result of these violations, Miller placed Fleming on final warning. When Miller learned Fleming wanted to request leave, she responded positively by helping him make the request. .Only after Fleming violated: policy multiple times while on final warning was he fired.\nFleming protests that his prior violations did not result in termination, and that therefore his recent violations could not have been the reason he was fired. This argument is roughly as convincing as a batter’s comparison of his third strike to the first two. Defendants “must be permitted to draw the line somewhere.” Leong v. Potter, 347 F.3d 1117, 1124 (9th Cir.2003). Here, Defendants endured dozens of infractions before finally drawing the line. An employer’s past leniency, in the form of warnings and second chances, does not oblige the employer to suffer further transgressions. The record, taken as a whole, could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for Fleming with respect to his retaliation claims.\nC. Breach of Contract\nFleming also claims that, even if his termination was lawful, his employment contract entitles him to compensation for unused “paid time off’ hours. He relies on the following clause in his Employee Handbook:\nUnused PTO [paid time off] accrual may be cashed out at full value... at the time of termination dr retirement' provided the employee has been employed at least ninety (90) days.\nDefendants contend Fleming is not entitled to this additional compensation, because he was fired. They point to a different clause in the same Handbook:\n[A]ny employee who... is involuntarily terminated for any reason other than a reduction-in-force or layoff due to lack of work.. .will not be paid for any unused PTO [paid time off] upon termination of employment....\nFleming argues these clauses'conflict and therefore create an ambiguity that should be resolved in his favor. Defendants argue there is no ambiguity: the former clause states a general rule that employees will be compensated for unused “paid time off’ hours, and the latter clause identifies an exception for fired employees;\n“Whether contract language is ambiguous, is a question of law.” Carpenters Pension Trust Fund for N. Cal. v. Underground Const. Co., 31 F.3d 776, 778 (9th Cir.1994). Under Arizona law, a contract is ambiguous “only if the language can reasonably be construed in more than one sense and the. construction cannot bé determined within the four corners of the instrument.” J.D. Land Co. v. Killian, 158 Ariz. 210, 212, 762 P.2d 124, 126 (Ct.App. 1988). Here, the disparity between these two clauses’ does not create an ambiguity. “Where there is an inconsistency between two provisions in a contract, [courts] construe the more'specific provision to qualify the more general provision.” Norman v. Recreation Ctrs. of Sun City, Inc., 156 Ariz. 425, 428, 752 P.2d 514, 517 (Ct.App. 1988). The competing clauses in the Handbook can be harmonized as follows: Employees generally are compensated for 'unused “paid time off’ hours, but not if they are fired. There is no ambiguity. Because Fleming was fired, \""he is not entitled to additional compensation.\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion' for Summary Judgment (Doc. 56) is granted in full.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk shall enter judgment in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiff. ’ The Clerk shall terminate this case.\n. In recent briefing, Fleming also, mentions a \""hostile work environment” and a failure to provide “accommodations.” (Doc. 60 at 9-10.) The Court views these passing references as part of Fleming's claim of illegal termination, not as separate claims. Indeed, Fleming clarifies he \""does not seek separate recovery based on the hostile environment itself,” and he mentions the'refusal to provide accommodations as confirmation that “Defendants created a pretext to justify the termination.” (Id.) Further, even if these were separate claims, they would fail. Fleming has not identified conduct sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute a hostile work environment. Manatt v. Bank of Am., NA, 339 F.3d 792, 798 (9th Cir.2003). And he did not allege any failure to accommodate in his complaint. (Doc. 1-1.)\n. Fleming does not identify any individuals within \""the unit,” nor does he specify their age, sex, religion, or disability status.\n. Although this fact is not specifically stated in the parties’ statements of facts or briefs, Fleming alleges he is Catholic in his complaint (see Doc. 1-1 at ¶¶ 14, 32), and Defendants do not dispute this in their answer (see Doc. 12 at ¶¶ 14, 32). ' ' ' ■\n. In a declaration submitted after the instant motion, Fleming claims he heard that Miller made \""negative comments about [his] disability.” (Doc. 61 at'H 195.) This claim flatly contradicts Fleming’s earlier deposition testimony: “Q: You are not aware that [Miller] made comments to you or anybody else regarding your medical condition and disability? A: Correct,” (Doc; 57-1 at 138.) Therefore the Court does not consider this claim. See Van Asdale v. Int’l Game Tech., 577 F.3d 989, 998-99 (9th Cir.2009)."",""type"":""majority""}],""judges"":[],""head_matter"":""John F. FLEMING, Plaintiff, v.

For the, reasons that follow, the Motion will be granted.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nSt. Luke’s Behavioral Hospital, LP (“St. Luke’s”) is a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona. It is owned and operated by IASIS Healthcare Corporation, the sole merhber of IASIS Healthcare, LLC (collectively “IASIS”).\nSt. Luke’s hired John Fleming in 2000 and fired him in 2012. Fleming claims his termination was illegally motivated by one or more of the following considerations: his sex, religion, age, disability, and statutorily protected activity. He also\' claims that, even if his termination was lawful, his employment contract entitles him to compensation for unused, “paid time off” hours.\nSt. Luke’s and IASIS (collectively “Defendants”), move for summary judgment on all these claims. They, contend Fleming was fired due to his poor performance and that he is not contractually entitled to any additional compensation.\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nA motion for summary judgment -tests whether the opposing party has sufficient evidence to merit a trial. Summary judgment should be granted if the evidence reveals no genuine dispute about any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A material fact is one that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law, and a factual dispute is genuine “if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).\nThe movant has the burden of showing the absence of genuine disputes of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). However, once the movant shows an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case, the burden shifts to the party resisting the motion. The party opposing summary judgment must thén “set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial” and may not rest upon the pleadings. Anderson, ill U.S. at 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505. To carry this burden, the nonmoving party must do more than simply show-there is “some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.” Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538(1986).\nIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, must not weigh the evidence or assess its- credibility, and must draw all justifiable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505. Where the record) taken as a whole, could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for trial. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348.\nIII. MATERIAL FACTS\nThe following facts áre drawn from the undisputed portions of Defendants’ statement of facts ’ (Doc. 57), Fleming’s statement of facts (Doc. 61), and parts of the record identified in the parties’ briefs. All evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Fleming.\nA. Evidence Relating to Whether Fleming, was Illegally Terminated\n- Fleming claims he was fired because of his sex, religion, age, and disability, and in retaliation for engaging in statutorily protected activity. Defendants contend Fleming was fired due to poor performance. Evidence relating to these claims is described below.\n1. Performance History\nIn 2000, St. Luke’s hired Fleming as a Therapist. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 17.) In 2005, Fleming began working in St. Luke’s Intake and Assessment Department. (Id. at ¶ 18.) He received annual performance-based raises. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 153.) He was good with patients and good at responding to crises, and patients liked him. (Id. at ¶ 200.) But there were problems.\nIn 2005, a supervisor reprimanded Fleming for (1) failing, to follow proper procedures for contacting physicians on call, (2) improperly filling out\' a doctor rotation sheet, (3) improperly assigning patients to beds, and (4) admitting a patient under the wrong insurance. (Doc. 57 at ¶¶ 21, 24, 26.) According to - the annual Performance Evaluation, Fleming was “struggling” with some of the patient intake processes and was “struggling” to complete patient assessments in a timely manner. (Id. at ¶ 29.)-However, the Evaluation also: included positive comments and concluded that Fleming “meets standards” overall. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 28.)\nIn 2006, a supervisor, reprimanded Fleming for improper and untimely submissions of work hours, (Doc. 57 at ¶ 33.) The supervisor also instructed him.to expedite the patient admissions process and to learn more about the “pre-certification” process of obtaining an insurance compar ny^ approval for treatment. (Id., at ¶¶ 35, 37.) According to the annual Performance Evaluation, Fleming needed to “expedite” the. patient admissions process, be “more thorough,” and show “more consistency.” (Id. at ¶ 39.) However, the Evaluation also includéd positive comments and concluded that Fleming “meets standards” overall. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 39.)\nIn 2007, supervisors reprimanded Fleming for (1) failing to complete patient evaluations, (2) failing to follow the behavioral health certification process,. (3) failing to document a call from a patient in crisis, (4) excessive unplanned absences, (5) inappropriate use of evaluation and treatment waivers, and (6) poor clinical judgment. (Doc. 57 at ¶¶ 42, 45, 47, 51, 54.) Fleming did not deny that his actions put a patient at risk. (Id. at ¶ 52.) A supervisor warned him that he should consider other employment options if he continues to make poor patient evaluations, (id. at ¶ 56.) According to the annual Performance Evaluation, Fleming needed improvement in “organization,” “time,” “documentation,” and number of “errors."" (Id. at ¶ 59.) However, the Evaluation also included positive comments and concluded that Fleming “Meets the Standard” in most areas. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 58.)\nIn 2008, a supervisor reprimanded Fleming for failing to pursue an appropriate treatment plan, thereby putting .a potentially suicidal patient at risk. ,(Doc. 57 .at ¶ 61.) The supervisor warned him that if he puts one more patient at risk, “the possibility of termination will be pursued.” (Id.) Weeks later, the supervisor also reprimanded Fleming for (1) failing to complete a- mandatory patient evaluation and. (2) failing to contact a .physician before transferring a patient.. (Id. at ¶¶ 64, 67.). The supervisor warned him that any further disciplinary actions “could result in termination.” (Id. at ¶ 67.) Later that year, supervisors reprimanded Fleming for.(l) disregarding instructions about admitting a patient, (2) excessive non-business Internet use, and (3) reeking of alcohol while at work. (Id. at ¶¶ 71, 75, 82.) According to the annual Performance Evaluation, Fleming needed to “follow the designated process” and “expedite” patient admissions. (Id. at ¶ 73.) However, the Evaluation also included positive comments and concluded that Fleming “meets standards” overall. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 73.)\nIn 2009, supervisors reprimanded Fleming for (1) failing to complete a patient evaluation, (2) taking a smoke break during a patient’s disposition, (3) excessive tardiness, (4) failing to complete the required number of patient assessments per shift, and (5) incorrectly filling out a “duty to warn” form., (Doc. 57 at ¶¶ 83, 86, 89.) According to -the annual Performance Evaluation, Fleming needed improvement in “expediting” the patient assessment process. (Id. at ¶ 91.) However, the Evaluation also included positive comments and concluded that Fleming “Meets the Standard” or “Exceeds the Standard” overall. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 91.)\nIn 2010, a supervisor reprimanded Fleming for his poor judgment and incomplete work with respect to patient care. (Doc. 57 at ¶\'95.) The supervisor warned him: “This is the final conference. Any further disciplinary action\' will result in termination.”- (Id.) Weeks later, the supervisor reprimanded Fleming for excessive unapproved absences. (Id. at ¶ 98.)- The supervisor warned him that another unexcused absence “will set in motion the final steps in the disciplinary process leading to termination.” (Id.) Later that\' year, the same supervisor reprimanded Fleming for (1) failing to follow up with discharged patients and (2) writing the\'wrong doctor’s name on an admission document. (Id. at ¶¶ 100, 102, 103.) Then a new supervisor, Julie Miller, filled out Fleming’s annual Performance Evaluation. (See id. at ¶ 105.) Miller noted that Fleming needed to do “more” patient admissions and needed to do patient pre-certifications “quickly.” (Id.) However, she also, included positive comments and concluded that Fleming “Meets the Standard’.’ or “Exceeds the Standard” overall. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 105.)\n■ In 2011, Miller reprimanded Fleming for (1) telling a patient no hospital beds were available instead of offering an assessment, (2) failing to perform pre-certifications and instead leaving them for the next shift, (3) tardiness, (4) failing to follow up .with discharged patients, (5) saying that he called Miller for a consultation when in fact he did.not, (6) saying that he checked his email .for an important message when in fact he did not,\' and (7) failing to write down information , given to a patient. (Doc. 57 at ¶¶ 107, 109, 111.) In the annual Performance Evaluation, Miller noted that Fleming needed to “maintain productivity” and “improve consistency.” (Id. at ¶ 112.) However, she also included positive comments and concluded that Fleming “meets standards” overall. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 112.) .\nThe month leading up to Fleming’s termination was eventful. In\' a Performance Evaluation dated September 4, 2012, Miller noted that Fleming’s; “documentation has been lacking information and he has had many incomplete forms” and that “he could work on doing a faster assessment/admit process and be more consistent with his work.” (Doc. 57 at ¶ 116.) She also included positive comments and concluded that Fleming “meets \'standards” overall. (See Doc. 61 at ¶ 153.) On September 10, Miller gave Fleming a final written warning for (1) sending improper docu-inentation to family members of two different patients, (2) seeing a patient for whom he"" failed to complete an authorization form, and .(3) failing to complete a patient assessment. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 121.) On September 13, Miller reprimanded, Fleming for failing to use a cover sheet when faxing a patient’s protected health information, in violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HI-PAA”). (I\'d at ¶ 118.) ■\nThe incident immediately preceding Fleming’s termination occurred oh September 25, 2012. Fleming assigned a 12-year-old patient to an overcapacity bed without completing the necessary procedures. (Id. at ¶¶ 130-40.) Fleming left the task of completing the overcapacity procedures for the next shift, telling his coworker Alisa Furch: “I’m not going to stay a moment longer, you can do it.” (Id. at ¶ 141.) Fleming could not stay longer because he was experiencing tremendous back pain and had lost feeling in his writing hand. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 138.) Fleming had already stayed at work longer than scheduled, and he thought completing the overcapacity procedures would be complicated and time consuming and would preclude the patient from receiving treatment.- (Id!) He had the authority to delegate the task to Furch. (Id. at ¶ 190.) When Miller-heard about this incident, however, she believed Fleming should have completed the overcapacity procedures himself because the patient was Fleming’s responsibility. (Doc. 57 at ¶¶ 142-45.)\nThe Human Resources Director, Amy Howell, recommended that Miller suspend Fleming and investigate the incident. (Id. at ¶¶120, 148.) Accordingly, Miller suspended Fleming. (Id. at ¶ 149.) Fleming had never been suspended before. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 153.) Miller then spoke with Furch and two other employees and reviewed patient documentation to determine whether Fleming had followed proper procedure. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 150.) She did not speak with Fleming during her investigation. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 192.) After the investigation, Miller and Howell concluded Fleming should be terminated. (Doc. 57 at ¶¶ 151-52.) Fleming’s prior disciplinary history played a role in their decision, according to later statements. (Id. at ¶ 153.) Howell then contacted the IASIS Vice President of Human Resources to explain the situation, discuss Fleming’s disciplinary history, and request authorization to terminate. (Id. at ¶ 154.) On October 1, Fleming met with Miller, Howell, and another St. Luke’s employee named Jennifer Govan.\'(Id. at ¶ 156; Doc. 57-1 at 78.) He Was told he was being terminated for failing to follow proper procedure while oh a final warning. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 156.)\n2. Sex Discrimination\nFleming believes many of the complaints that led to his reprimands targeted him because he was male. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 173.) When\' Fleming requested time off, female employees with ’less seniority were given time off, but Fleming was not. (Id. at ¶ 175.) On one occasion, female employees with less s\'eniority were allowed to attend an employee awards ceremony, but Fleming was not. (Id. at ¶ 176.) When-Fleming requested a preferred workstation due to his back pain and his role as a lead therapist, his request was- denied, and a female employee with less seniority used the workstation instead. (Id. at ¶ 197.)\nFleming\'was also treated differently from two female employees who were involved in the September 25 incident preceding his termination. Furch, like Fleming, did not complete the overcapacity procedures. (Id. at ¶ 190.) And Kathy Bouise did not reserve a, bed that would have prevented the need for overcapacity procedures in the first place. (Id. at ¶ 185.) Neither was disciplined. (Id. at ¶ 184.) In addition, other employees in “the unit” who failed to take appropriate action were not disciplined. (Id. at ¶¶ 184, 186-87.)\nNó one ever told Fleming he was fired because of his gender. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 158.) He néver heard Miller make any negative comments about his gehder. (Id. at ¶ 164.) No other \'evidence relating to sex discrimination is identified in the parties’ statements of facts or briefs.\n‘3. Religious Discrimination\nFleming is Catholic. Fleming believes many of the complaints that led to his reprimands targeted him because he was more religious than other employees. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 173.) Miller once said she would not go to a Catholic church. (Doc. 57-1 at 94-95.) Govan said the Catholic Church was a “sick religion” and talked about priests and defiling young boys. (Id. at 96.)\nGovan was not involved, in the decision to fire Fleming. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 155.) No other evidence relating to religious discrimination , is identified in the • parties’ statements of facts or briefs.\n4.Age Discrimination\nFleming is sixty years old. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 16.) He believes many of the complaints that led to his reprimands targeted \'him because \'he was older than other employees. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 173.)\nNo one ever told him Fleming he was fired because of his age. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 159.) He never heard Miller make any negative comments about his age. (Id. at.li 163.) No other evidence relating to age discrimination is identified in the parties’ statements of facts or briefs.\n5.Disability Discrimination\nFleming developed carpal tunnel syndrome and back problems. (Doc. 57-1 at 93.) Miller and another supervisor knew about Fleming’s back problems and reliance on pain medication. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 194.) Fleming requested a more convenient workstation due to his back pain. (Id. at ¶ 197.) He did. not provide Miller with a doctor’s note stating his need for the workstation. (Doc. 57-1 at 103.) Miller denied his request. (Doc. 61 at ¶¶ 196-97.) Fleming felt that his supervisors perceived his disabilities as inhibiting his performance, and he was not allowed to perform the same tasks as female employees. (Id. at ¶ 201.)\nNo one ever told Fleming he was fired because of his medical conditions. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 160.) He never heard Miller make any negative comments about his medical conditions. (Id. at 11.165.) No other evidence relating to disability discrimination is identified in the parties’ statements of facts or briefs.\n6.Retaliation\nFleming claims he was fired in retaliation for complaining about co-workers’ behavior and for requesting leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLÁ”). Evidence relating to these claims is described below.\na. Complaint about coworkers’ behavior\nApproximately three years before he Was fired, Fleming complained to -Miller that co-workers were making inappropriate comments involving, age, sex, arid religion. (Doc. 57-1 at 104-05.)\nNo one ever told Fleming he was fired because he complained about co-workers. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 162.) No other evidence relating to this retaliation claim is identified in the parties’ statements of facts or briefs,\nb. Request for FMLA leave\nOn September 11, 2012, Fleming told Miller he intended to take FMLA leave to. receive surgery on his hand and pain management for his spine. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 198.) Miller directed Fleming to the Human Resources Department, where he received FMLA paperwork. (Doc. 57 at ¶ 127.) He submitted this paperwork and received a letter from Human Resources on September 18 confirming receipt of his request. (Doc. 61 at ¶ 198.) He was then suspended on September 26 and fired on October 1, (Doc. 57 at ¶¶ 130, 149, 156; Doc. 57-1 at 78.)\nNo one ever told Fleming he was fired because he requested FMLA leave. (Doc""; 57 at ¶ 161.) No other evidence relating to this retaliation claim is identified in the parties’ statements of facts or briefs.\nB. Evidence Relating to Whether Fleming is Contractually Entitled to Additional Compensation i\nFleming also claims that, even if his termination was lawful, his employment contract entitles him to compensation for unused “paid time off’ hours. Fleming relies on a clause in the IASIS Employee Handbook. On page 26, the Handbook states:\nUnused PTO [paid time off] accrual may be cashed out at full value... at the time of termination or retirement provided the employee has been employed at least ninety (90) days. ■ -\n(Doc. 61 at ¶ 199.) Fleming received a copy of the Handbook in 2007. (Doe, 57\' at ¶ 13.)\nDefendants contend a differerit clause in the Handbook precludes Fleming’s claim because he was\' fired. Ori page 25, the Handbook states:\n[A]ny employee who... is involuntarily terminated for any reason other than a reduction-in-force or layoff due to lack of work.. .will not be paid for any unused PTO [paid time off] upon termination of employment_\n(Id. at ¶ 12.) Fleming was involuntarily terminated for a reason other than a reduction-in-force or layoff due to lack of work. (Id. at ¶ 169.) ""•\nIV. ANALYSIS\nFleming claims his termination constituted unlawful discrimination, retaliation, and breach of contract. Each claim is considered in turn. . - •\nA. Discrimination,\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (“Title VII”),\' prohibits an employer from discriminating against an individual because of the individual’s “sex” or “religion,” among other factors. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(l). The Age Discrimination-in Employment Act of 1967, as amended (“ADEA”), prohibits an employer from discriminating against an individual because of the individual’s “age.” 29 U.S.C. §. 623(a)(1). The Americans, with Disabilities- Act (“ADA”) prohibits an employer from discriminating against a qualified individual . “on the basis -. of. disability.” 42 U.S.C. §. 12112(a). Fleming claims his termination violated all three statutory prohibitions. He offers no direct evidence -of discriminatory intent; rather, he relies on circumstantial evidence.\nFleming’s discrimination claims all proceed under the McDonnell Douglas three-step burden-shifting framework: (1) Fleming must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination; (2) if he does, Defendants must then articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its conduct; and (3) if they do, Fleming must then demonstrate that the articulated reason is a pretext for discrimination. Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 888-89 (9th Cir. 1994) (applying framework to Title VII and ADEA claims); see also Snead v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1093 (9th Cir.2001) (applying framework to ADA claim).\n1. Prima facie case\nTo state a prima facie case of Title VII discrimination, Fleming must show that (1) he belongs to a protected class, (2) he was performing his job satisfactorily, (3) he suffered an adverse employment action, and (4) he was treated less favorably than other employees with similar qualifications. Vasquez v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 349 F.3d 634, 640 n. 5 (9th Cir.2003). Similarly, to state a prima facie case of ADEA discrimination, Fleming must show that (1) he belongs to a protected class/ (2) he was performing his job satisfactorily, (3) he. suffered’ an adverse employment action, and (4) he was replaced by substantially younger employees with similar qualifications. Coleman v. Quaker Oats Co., 232 F.3d 1271, 1281 (9th Cir.2000). Finally, to state a prima facie case of ADA discrimination, Fleming\'must show that (1) he is a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA, (2) he was able to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation, and (3) he suffered an adverse employment action because of his disability. Allen v. Pac. Bell, 348 F.3d 1113, 1114 (9th Cir.2003). In each case the requisite degree of proof is “minimal,” and Fleming “need only offer evidence which gives rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.” Wallis, 26 F.3d at 889 (in context of Title VII. and ADEA claims); see also Kinney v. Emmis Operation Co., 291 Fed.Appx. 789, 790 (9th Cir.2007) (applying same standard to ADA claim).\nIt is doubtful whether Fléming has established a prima facie case of any discrimination. His termination occurred shortly after he violated company policy multiple times while on final warning. See Diaz v. Eagle Produce Ltd. P’ship, 521 F.3d 1201, 1208 (9th Cir.2008) (affirming lack of ADEA prima facie case where employee “over an extended period openly violated [company policy] and continued to do so even after receiving a warning”). And his disciplinary history appears to be unparalleled among his co-workers. See Leong v. Potter, 347 F.3d 1117, 1124 (9th Cir.2003) (affirming lack of Title VII prima facie casé where plaintiff was the only employee subject to a “Last Chance Agreement” and had unmatched “record of misconduct”).\nNevertheless, given the low threshold required at this first step of the McDonnell Douglas framework, the Court assumes without, deciding that Fleming has established a prima facie case. See Coleman, 232 F.3d at 1282 (taking this approach).\n2. Legitimate nondiscriminatory reason\nThe-burden now shifts to Defendants to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for firing Fleming. Defendants have articulated two such reasons: (1) Fleming violated company policy on September 25, 2012, after receiving a final warning, and (2) Fleming had also violated company policy many times before then. Defendants have met their burden of production.\n3. Pretext\nThe burden now shifts back to Fleming to demonstrate that these articulated reasons are merely a pretext for discriminátion. The evidentiary threshold is higher at this step than at the prima facie case, as Fleming must produce “specific, Substantial evidence” of pretext. Wallis, 26 F.3d at 890 (in context of Title VII and ADEA claims); see also Snead, 237 F.3d at 1094 (finding evidence insufficient to show pretext even though it was sufficient for ADA prima facie case). In an attempt to refute Defendants’ articulated reasons for firing him, Fleming offers evidence of two types.\n. First, Fleming offers evidence that his job performance was satisfactory overall. He relies on the annual. Performance Evaluations, which generally placed him in the “meets expectations” category. But this categorization, in light of the dozens of reprimands Fleming earned over the years, seems little more than a conclusion that the evaluator was not ready to recommend termination yet. Fleming attempts to characterize his reprimands as\' evidence of discrimination, but that characterization is untenable because he does not dispute most of the\' underlying facts leading up to the reprimands.\nAnd even if the “meets expectations” label is meaningful, it is not evidence of satisfactory performance in the most relevant timeframe. The last Evaluation was made on September 4, 2012. That Evaluation could not have anticipated that on September 10 Fleming would receive a final written warning for improper and incomplete\' documentation, that on September 13 he would fax confidential patient information in violation of HIPAA, or that on September 25 he- would fail- to complete a mandatory procedural task and would leave it for the next shift. These incidents alone constitute a legitimate h\'on-discriminatory reason for termination which is not impugned by Fleming’s performance-related evidence.\nSecond, Fleming offers evidence downplaying the significance of his violations of company policy. In his affidavit, he declares that\'his actions on September 25 were justified under the circumstances, that other employees were also partially responsible fdr the September 25 incident, and that his prior infractions were too minor, infrequent, and remote in time to call for termination. But this evidence misses the mark. “The focus of a pretext inquiry is whether the employer’s stated reason was honest, not whether it was accurate, wise, or well-cónsidered.” Green v. Maricopa Cty. Cmty. Coll. Sch. Dist., 265 F.Supp.2d 1110, 1128 (D.Ariz.2003) (citation omitted). Fleming’s evidence goes primarily to the wisdom of Defendants’ termination decision, not its sincerity. This evidence does not indicate dishonesty, and it is dwarfed by the well-documented and largely undisputed evidence of Fleming’s lengthy disciplinary history.\nIn sum, Fleming has not produced specific, substantial evidence of pretext. The record, taken as a whole, could not lead a rational trier) of fact to find for Fleming with respect to his discrimination claims.\nB. Retaliation\nFleming also claims he was terminated in retaliation for complaining about coworkers’ inappropriate behavior and for requesting FMLA leave.\n1.. Complaint about, co- . workers’ behavior\nTitle VII, the ADEA, and the ADA all prohibit an employer from retaliating against an employee for engaging in protected activity. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a) (Title VII); 29 U.S.C. § 623(d) (ADEA); 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a) (ADA). Fleming claims he was fired -in retaliation for engaging in the protected activity of complaining about co-workers’ inappropriate comments involving age, sex, and religion.\nThese retaliation claims proceed under the familiar McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework: (1) Fleming must first establish a prima facie case; (2) Defendants must then articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its conduct; and (3) Fleming must then demonstrate pretext. Pardi v. Kaiser Found. Hosp., 389 F.3d 840, 849 (9th Cir.2004) (ADA retaliation claim); Hashimoto v. Dalton, 118 F.3d 671, 680 (9th Cir.1997) (Title. VII retaliation claim); see also Merrick v. Farmers Ins., 892 F.2d 1434, 1441 (9th Cir.1990) (applying Title Vil discrimination case law to ADEA retaliation case). To establish a prima facie case, Fleming must show that (1) he engaged in a protected activity, (2) he suffered an adverse employment decision, and (3) there was a causal link between the two. Pardi, 389 F.3d at. 849; Hashimoto, 118 F.3d at 679; see also O’Day v. McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co., 79 F.3d 756, 763 (9th Cir.1996) (ADEA retaliation claim).\nFleming has not shown a causal link between his complaint about co-workers and his termination. Fleming’s only evidence of causation is that his termination occurred after his complaint. The problem is the three years in between. While temporal proximity between protected activity and adversé employment action may suggest a causal link in some cases, adverse action taken three years afterward “suggests, by itself, no causality at all.” Clark Cty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 274, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001).\n2. Request for FMLA leave\nThe FMLA gives .employees the right to take leave for- certain reasons. 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a). The FMLA also prohibits employers from interfering with the exercise or attempted exercise of this right. 29 U.S.C. §-2615(a)(1). As a result, “employers cannot use the taking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions.” Bachelder v. Am. W. Airlines, Inc., 259 F.3d 1112, 1122 (9th Cir.2001) (alteration and emphasis omitted) [quoting 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c)). Fleming claims Defendants used his request for FMLA leave as a negative factor in deciding to fire him.\nThis claim does not proceed under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Xin Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F.3d 1125, 1136 (9th Cir.2003). Instead, the claim will survive\' summary judgment if there is a triable issue of material fact as to whether Fleming’s FMLA leave request was impermissibly considered as a factor in his termination. Id. Here, there is no such triable issue.\nFleming’s theory is that, because he was fired two weeks after requesting leave, the “timing of the request and the termination alone create an issue of triable fact here.” (Doc. 60 at 13.) In support of this theory, he selectively cites portions of opinions by the First, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits. None of these opinions actually supports his theory, and in fact the first two contradict it.\nFleming quotes a First Circuit opinion for the proposition that “close temporal proximity between two events may give rise to an inference of causal, connection.” (Doc. 60 at 13 (quoting Hodgens v. General Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 168 (1st Gir.1998)).) He refers to this quoted statement as a “holding.” (Id.). Far from it. The Hodgens. court affirmed summary judgment against the plaintiff employee. 144 F.3d at 173. -And the facts there were, if anything, more plaintiff-friendly. Not only had the employee been fired “shortly after” taking ;FMLA leave, but he also had a “good work history” for three of the five preceding years and his supervisor had recently complained about his “excessive absences.” Id. at 170. By contrast, Fleming had a checkered work history for all seven years preceding his termination, and-his supervisor helped him request FMLA leave by, directing him to Human Resources for the appropriate paperwork. If summary judgment was justified in’ Hod-gens, it is justified here.\nFleming also relies on a Sixth Circuit opinion for the proposition that “close temporal proximity between FMLA leave and termination may be sufficient to meet the low threshold of proof necessary to establish a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge.” (Doc. 60 at 13 (citing Seeger v. Cincinnati Bell Tel. Co., LLC, 681 F.3d 274, 283 (6th Cir.2012)).) It is true that the Seeger court held temporal proximity sufficient for a prima facie case of retaliation. 681 F.3d at 284. -But that holding is irrelevant. The prima facie case is part of the McDonnell Douglas framework, which the Ninth Circuit does not apply to FMLA retaliation claims. Liu, 347 F.3d at 1136. And even under this framework, Fleming would flunk the third step of demonstrating pretext. As the Seeger court recognized, Sixth Circuit precedent is clear that “temporal proximity cannot be the sole basis for finding pretext.” 681 F.3d at 285 (quoting Donald v. Sybra, Inc., 667 F.3d 757, 763 (6th Cir 2012)). The Seeger court, like the Hodgens court, affirmed summary judgment against the plaintiff employee, despite his prima facie case. Id. at 287.\nFinally, Fleming relies most heavily on a Ninth Circuit opinion, which he quotes for the proposition that the temporal proximity between his leave request and termination “provides supporting evidence of a connection between the two events.” (Doc. 60 at 13 (quoting Liu, 347 F.3d at 1137).) The key word there is “supporting.” Although the Liu court reversed summary judgment against a plaintiff who had been terminated after taking leave, 347 F.3d at 1137, the timing of the termination played only a “supporting” role in the court’s opinion. The court first noted that the decision to fire the plaintiff was based largely on her supervisor’s “subjective evaluation,” which gave the plaintiff low scores in “vague” categories such as “being upbeat.” Id. at ,1136-37. The court also noted, a suspiciously steep drop in overall score from.the plaintiffs former evaluation. Id. In addition, the court found that the supervisor’s behavior toward the plaintiff — namely, his “repeated denials of her leave and comments about his increased work-load” — suggested a negative attitude toward her taking leave. Id. Only after discussing all. this evidence did the court state “the proximity in time between the leave and her termination also provides supporting evidence of a connection between the two events.” Id. Therefore, the only thing Liu established about the timing of termination is that it can support, a retaliation claim for which there is already offier evidence. It did not hold that timing alone creates a triable issue of fact. Indeed, such a rule would place employers in a dilemma as to any unsatisfactory employee who requests leave: either keep him or face trial. The FMLA does not impose this Hobson’s choice.\nHaving rejected Fleming’s “timing is enough” theory, the Court returns to the broader question: is there- a triable issue as to whether Defendants considered Fleming’s leave request in deciding to fire him? The answer is no. The record is replete with instances of Fleming’s violations of company policy. As a result of these violations, Miller placed Fleming on final warning. When Miller learned Fleming wanted to request leave, she responded positively by helping him make the request. .Only after Fleming violated: policy multiple times while on final warning was he fired.\nFleming protests that his prior violations did not result in termination, and that therefore his recent violations could not have been the reason he was fired. This argument is roughly as convincing as a batter’s comparison of his third strike to the first two. Defendants “must be permitted to draw the line somewhere.” Leong v. Potter, 347 F.3d 1117, 1124 (9th Cir.2003). Here, Defendants endured dozens of infractions before finally drawing the line. An employer’s past leniency, in the form of warnings and second chances, does not oblige the employer to suffer further transgressions. The record, taken as a whole, could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for Fleming with respect to his retaliation claims.\nC. Breach of Contract\nFleming also claims that, even if his termination was lawful, his employment contract entitles him to compensation for unused “paid time off’ hours. He relies on the following clause in his Employee Handbook:\nUnused PTO [paid time off] accrual may be cashed out at full value... at the time of termination dr retirement\' provided the employee has been employed at least ninety (90) days.\nDefendants contend Fleming is not entitled to this additional compensation, because he was fired. They point to a different clause in the same Handbook:\n[A]ny employee who... is involuntarily terminated for any reason other than a reduction-in-force or layoff due to lack of work.. .will not be paid for any unused PTO [paid time off] upon termination of employment....\nFleming argues these clauses\'conflict and therefore create an ambiguity that should be resolved in his favor. Defendants argue there is no ambiguity: the former clause states a general rule that employees will be compensated for unused “paid time off’ hours, and the latter clause identifies an exception for fired employees;\n“Whether contract language is ambiguous, is a question of law.” Carpenters Pension Trust Fund for N. Cal. v. Underground Const. Co., 31 F.3d 776, 778 (9th Cir.1994). Under Arizona law, a contract is ambiguous “only if the language can reasonably be construed in more than one sense and the. construction cannot bé determined within the four corners of the instrument.” J.D. Land Co. v. Killian, 158 Ariz. 210, 212, 762 P.2d 124, 126 (Ct.App. 1988). Here, the disparity between these two clauses’ does not create an ambiguity. “Where there is an inconsistency between two provisions in a contract, [courts] construe the more\'specific provision to qualify the more general provision.” Norman v. Recreation Ctrs. of Sun City, Inc., 156 Ariz. 425, 428, 752 P.2d 514, 517 (Ct.App. 1988). The competing clauses in the Handbook can be harmonized as follows: Employees generally are compensated for \'unused “paid time off’ hours, but not if they are fired. There is no ambiguity. Because Fleming was fired, ""he is not entitled to additional compensation.\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion\' for Summary Judgment (Doc. 56) is granted in full.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk shall enter judgment in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiff. ’ The Clerk shall terminate this case.\n. In recent briefing, Fleming also, mentions a ""hostile work environment” and a failure to provide “accommodations.” (Doc. 60 at 9-10.) The Court views these passing references as part of Fleming\'s claim of illegal termination, not as separate claims. Indeed, Fleming clarifies he ""does not seek separate recovery based on the hostile environment itself,” and he mentions the\'refusal to provide accommodations as confirmation that “Defendants created a pretext to justify the termination.” (Id.) Further, even if these were separate claims, they would fail. Fleming has not identified conduct sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute a hostile work environment. Manatt v. Bank of Am., NA, 339 F.3d 792, 798 (9th Cir.2003). And he did not allege any failure to accommodate in his complaint. (Doc. 1-1.)\n. Fleming does not identify any individuals within ""the unit,” nor does he specify their age, sex, religion, or disability status.\n. Although this fact is not specifically stated in the parties’ statements of facts or briefs, Fleming alleges he is Catholic in his complaint (see Doc. 1-1 at ¶¶ 14, 32), and Defendants do not dispute this in their answer (see Doc. 12 at ¶¶ 14, 32). \' \' \' ■\n. In a declaration submitted after the instant motion, Fleming claims he heard that Miller made ""negative comments about [his] disability.” (Doc. 61 at\'H 195.) This claim flatly contradicts Fleming’s earlier deposition testimony: “Q: You are not aware that [Miller] made comments to you or anybody else regarding your medical condition and disability? A: Correct,” (Doc; 57-1 at 138.) Therefore the Court does not consider this claim. See Van Asdale v. Int’l Game Tech., 577 F.3d 989, 998-99 (9th Cir.2009).', 'type': 'majority'}]"

INTRODUCTION\nThis lawsuit involves a contract dispute between Plaintiff, Blitz Telecom Consulting, LLC (“Blitz”), and Defendant, Peerless Network, Inc. (“Peerless”), over Peerless’ alleged nonpayment of co-marketing fees owed to Blitz for telecommunications traffic Blitz-placed on Peerless’ network. To provide context for the parties’ .dispute, the Court finds it prudent to begin by outlining the general framework of how telecommunications services — most pertinently, telephone services — are provided and paid for in the United States.\nFundamentally, there are two types of telephone traffic: local and long-distance. When a customer wishes to complete a local telephone call, the customer begins by dialing the call through his “originating” local exchange carrier (“LEC”) (i.e., AT&T, Sprint, BellSouth, etc.). The originating LEC then transmits the call- to the call recipient’s “terminating” LEC. The terminating LEC ultimately connects the call to its recipient. In the case of a local call, the originating LEC’s customer pays the originating LEC for initiating the call and the originating LEC pays the terminating LEC for completing the call. This compensation structure is termed “reciprocal compensation.” In re Implementation of the Local Competition Provisions in the Telecomms. Act of 1996, 11 FCC Red. 15499, ¶ 1034 (1996); 47 U.S.C. § 251(b)(5).\nWhen a customer wishes to complete a long-distance call, the customer again begins by dialing the call through his originating LEC. The originating LEC then collaborates with ■ a long-distance interex-change carrier (“IXC”) which facilitates transmission of the call by carrying the call on. its, own network until it reaches the call recipient’s terminating LEC. The terminating LEC then connects the call to its recipient. Instead of reciprocal compensation, the LECs involved in a long-distance call assess an “access charge” to the IXC for the privilege of using the LECs' physical facilities to connect the- call. The originating -LEC’s customer pays the IXC directly for its services, which in turn pays the access charges imposed by the LECs. Implementation of Local Competition Provisions, 11 FCC Red. 15499, ¶ 1035; see also 47 C.F.R. §§ 69.1-69.5.\nWhere problems are beginning to emerge is with the use of prepaid calling cards to complete long-distance calls. Ordinarily, a customer who wants to make a call with a prepaid calling card begins by dialing a toll-free or an out-of-area “access number” through his originating LEC. This access number allows the' customer to reach the calling card service provider’s centralized switching platform. The switching platform then transmits the call to the intended recipient. Similar tó a long-distance call, the origináting LEC recognizes the access number as a long-distance number and assesses an access charge to the calling card service provider. The calling card service provider debits against the balance of the customer’s prepaid calling card and pays the access charge imposed by the originating LEC. In re Regulation of Prepaid Calling Card Servs., 21 FCC Rcd. 7290, ¶ 2 (2006); In re AT&T Corp. Petition for Declaratory Ruling Regarding Enhanced Prepaid Calling Card Servs., 20 FCC Red. 4826, ¶¶ 3-5 (2005).\nIncreasingly, prepaid calling card companies are issuing prepaid calling cards bearing access numbers within customers’ local calling areas. For example, such a prepaid calling card purchased by a customer in Miami, Florida would require the customer to dial an access number with a 305 area code. Because the access number is local, the originating LEC through which the customer initiates his long-distance call views the call as local; the originating LEC therefore transmits the call to the access number’s LEC as if it will act as the terminating LEC for a local call. However, the access number’s LEC is actually a switching platform operated by the calling card service provider. The calling card service provider then transmits the call as a long-distance call to the intended recipient. Because the originating LEC only recognizes the call as a local call, the originating LEC — expecting to be paid under the reciprocal compensation structure — never assesses an access charge to the calling card service provider. The result is that the calling card service provider debits against the balance of the customer’s prepaid calling card at the same rate, but never pays any fees to which the originating LEC would normally be entitled had the access number been a toll-free or an out-of-area number.. .\nUnderstandably, originating LECs have sued to recover the avoided access charges. See, e.g., Broadvosx-CLEC, LLC v. AT & T Corp., 98 F.Supp.3d 839 (D.Md. 2015); Dollar Phone Access, Inc. v. AT & T Inc., No. 14-CV-3240 (SLT)(LB), 2015 WL 430286, at *1-3 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 2, 2015). One such lawsuit, Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. IDT Telecom, Inc., No. 3:09-CV-01268-P (N.D.Tex. Mar. 9, 2012) (hereinafter referred to as the “IDT Decision”), finds itself as the focal point of the instant litigation. Initiated in a Texas federal district court, the IDT Decision involved a number of LECs who sought to recover the value of access charges avoided by prepaid calling card service providers. Id. at 2-4. In granting partial summary judgment in favor of the LECs on the issue of liability, the IDT Decision held that all prepaid calling card traffic — no matter where a call originates or terminates — is subject- to access charges which must be paid by the service provider. Id, at 9-13. The case subsequently .settled on the issue of damages. See Dollar Phone, 2015 WL 430286, at *3. As will be revealed shortly, Peerless relies heavily on the IDT Decision to justify its actions in this case.\nII. BACKGROUND\nA. Facts\nBlitz’ business involves purchasing telephone numbers from various telecommunications carriers (such as LECs ancj IXCs) and subsequently marketing and reselling those numbers in bulk, along with other associated services, to companies and telecommunications carriers who offer telephone services to end consumers at a discounted price. (Doc. 55-1, ¶¶ 4-6). Many, but not all, of the companies to which Blitz resells. these telephone numbers are prepaid calling card service .providers. (Id. ¶ 4). Peerless is .a telecommunications carrier whose subsidiaries provide local exchange and interexchange telephone services. (Doc. 67-1, ¶ 2).\nOn November 9,2010, Blitz and Peerless entered into an IP Control Agreement (the “Contract”) whereby Peerless- agreed to assign- telephone numbers to Blitz for a fee. (Contract § 3.5; Contract App. A, p. 1). The Contract contemplates that Blitz would then use these numbers to, place traffic on Peerless’ network either by selling the numbers in bulk to other carriers and prepaid calling card providers, or by originating the traffic : itself. (Contract §§ 3.5, 7.4; Doc. 55-1, ¶ .8; Doc. 67-1, .¶ 4). In exchange, Peerless agreed to pay a 30% commission, to Blitz each month. (Contract App. A § 1.1). This commission,, referred to as the “co-marketing fee,” was calculated based on revenues Peerless collected from certain charges it imposed on the customers and carriers whose traffic Blitz brought to Peerless’ network. (Id.).\nFrom 2010 through approximately May or June 2012, Peerless accounted for and paid the ■ monthly co-marketing fees to Blitz. (Doc. 55-1, ¶ 9; Doc. 67-1, ¶ 9). However, on April 11, 2012, Peerless notified Blitz by mail that it would no longer remit co-marketing fees to Blitz because of the IDT Decision, which became a final order on April 9, 2012. (Doc. 55-3). In its letter to Blitz, Peerless asserted that it was entitled to modify the parties’ agreement pursuant to Section 23 of the Contract, which provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\nIn the event of (a) any legislative, regulatory, Judical [sic] or other legal action that materially affects the ability of a Party to perform any material obligation under this Agreement, or (b) any FCC rule, or (c) the enactment or amendment to any applicable Commission rule, Service Guideline, or Commission order or-arbitration award purporting to apply the provisions of the 'Act' (individually and collectively “Change in Law”), either Party may, on thirty (30) days’ written notice to the other Party..., require that the affected provision(s) be renegotiated, or that new terms and-conditions be added to this Agreement, if applicable.\n(Contract § 23) (hereinafter referred to as the “Change in Law” provision). It was, and ’remains, Peerless’ contention that the IDT Decision constitutes a Change in Law that materially affected its ability to perform a material obligation under the Contract, thus authorizing 'Peerless to cease paying Blitz co-marketing fees. Blitz disagrees, and the instant litigation ensued.\nB. Procedural History\nBlitz initiated this action on February 24, 2014 by filing a Complaint which alleges four claims for relief: breach of contract,, quantum meruit, declaratory judgment, and equitable accounting. (Doc. 1). On January 5, 2015, Peerless filed its Amended Answer and Affirmative Defenses. (Doc. 30). Peerless additionally alleges two counterclaims against Blitz for breach of contract and quantum meruit arising out of Blitz’ alleged nonpayment for services provided by Peerless under the Contract. (Id. at pp. 21-26). Blitz now moves for summary judgment on Counts III and IV of its Complaint and Peerless moves for summary judgment on all four of Blitz’ claims. •\nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n“The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The party moving for summary judgment must “cit[e] to particular parts of. materials in the record, .including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations..., admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials” to support its position that it is .entitled to summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). “The court need consider only the cited materials,” but may also consider any other material in the record. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3).\nAn issue of. fact is “genuine” only if “a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A fact is “material” if the fact could affect the outcome of the lawsuit under the governing law. Id. The moving party bears the initial burden of identifying those portion^ of the record demonstrating a lack of genuine dispute of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); Hickson Corp. v. N. Crossarm Co., Inc., 357 F.3d 1256, 1260 (11th Cir.2004). If the movant shows “an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party’s case,” the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to demonstrate that there are, in fact, genuine \""disputes of material facts. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548; see also Porter v. Ray, 461 F.3d 1315, 1320 (11th Cir.2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 996, 127 S.Ct. 516, 166 L.Ed.2d 371 (2006).\nTo satisfy its burden, the non-mbving party “must do more than' simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.” Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). Rather, the non-movant must go beyond the pleadings and “come forward with specific facts showing that thére is a genuine issue for trial.” Id. at 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348 (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 600, 118 S.Ct. 1584, 140 L.Ed.2d 759 (1998) (holding that a non-movant carries its burden on summary judgment only by “identify[ing] affirmative evidence” which creates a genuine dispute of material fact).\nIn determining whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists, the Court must read the evidence and draw all factual inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and must resolve any reasonable doubts in the non-movant’s favor. Shop v. City of Atlanta, Co., 485 F.3d 1130, 1136 (11th. Cir.2007). Summary judgment should only be granted “[wjhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact, to find for the non-moving party.” Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nBlitz moves for summary judgment on Counts III and IV of‘its Complaint, which allege claims for declaratory judgment under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202, and for equitable accounting, respectively. Peerless movés for summary judgment on' all four of Blitz’ claims. The Court addresses the parties’ arguments in' the most logical order.\nA. Applicable Law\nAs a preliminary matter, the Court must determine the applicable law for each claim. A' federal court sitting in diversity applies the-substantive law of the state in Which it sits’. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). The Court will therefore apply Florida láw to Blitz’ quantum meruit and equitable accounting claims. However, due to a choice of law provision contained within the Contract, the Court will apply Illinois law to Blitz’ breach of contract claim. (Contract § 12).\nRegarding Blitz’ declaratory judgment claim,..the Erie Doctrine also requires a federal court sitting in diversity to apply the .substantive law of the state in which it sits to substantive issues raised in a claim brought .pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act. Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Walbrook Ins. Co. 41 F.3d 764, 772-73 (1st Cir.1994). Notwithstanding, where a contractual choice of law provision governs a substantive issue, the Court applies the substantive law chosen by the parties. Thus, the Court will apply -Illinois* substantive law to the extent Blitz seeks declaratory relief relative to its breach-of contract claim.-and Florida substantive law to the extent-Blitz seeks'declaratory relief relative to its quantum meruit and equitable aecounting.claims.\nB. Whether the IDT Decision Changed Telecommunications Law\nThe crux of Blitz’ breach of contract, quantum meruit, and declaratory judgment claims .is whether Peerless breached the Contract by failing to pay co-marketing fees. To that end, Peerless moves for summary judgment on the narrow issue.of whether the IDT Decision Represents “a material change in telecommunications law.” (Doc. 109, pp. 11, 17). Peerless contends that it does, arguing that the IDT Decision changed telecommunications law by holding that prepaid calling card, service providers, are responsible for paying access charges assessed on calls made through prepaid calling cards, regardless of the routing of the call or where the call originated. In that instance, Peerless asserts that it would no longer be obligated to pay .Blitz the co-marketing fees. (Id. at pp., 14-17). , „\nHowever, it is not possible for the IDT Decision to constitute a change in federal telecommunications law, as district courts “lack authority to render prece-dential decisions” that would bind other parties, other courts, or other judges. Am. Elec. Power Co. v. Connecticut, 564 U.S. 410, 131 S.Ct. 2527, 2540, 180 L.Ed.2d 435 (2011). Indeed, a district court’s power is limited solely to adjudicating the issues before it, binding only those who are-parties to the lawsuit. See id. It is undisputed that the IDT Decision was rendered, by a federal district court in the Northern District of Texas and has not been confirmed or adopted by either the FCC or any court having the authority to create binding precedent on the-parties to this lawsuit. To the extent the IDT Decision could be construed as changing,' modifying,- adding to, or departing from the state of telecommunications law, it only did' so relative to the parties of that particular lawsuit. The IDT Decision therefore is not “a material change in -telecommunications law,” and Peerless will be denied summary judgment on that issue.' - ■\nC. Peerless’ Motion for Summary Judgment on Count III\nNext, the Court examines Peerless’ motion for summary judgment as it relates to Blitz’ declaratory judgment claim. (Doc. 109, pp. 6-8). Peerless raises two threshold issues which it insists preclude the Court from granting the declaratory relief Blitz seeks. First, Peerless asserts that no actual controversy exists between the parties. Second,. Peerless contends that the declaratory relief Blitz seeks is duplicative of the relief requested in its breach of contract and quantum meruit claims.\nThe Declaratory Judgment Act grants to the federal district courts the power to “declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.” 28 U.S.C. § 2201. An essential element for a declaratory, judgment action is the existence of an “actual controversy” between the parties, a term which holds the same meaning as the cases and controversies requirement of Article III to the United States Constitution. Aetna Life Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 239-40, 57 S.Ct. 461, 81 L.Ed. 617 (1937). In that sense, an “actual controversy” exists where “there is a substantial contROversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.” Md. Cas. Co. v. Pac. Coal & Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941). Ordinárily, a controversy is' not sufficiently immediate or real where the parties’ dispute is only hypothetical and not yet ripe, has been rendered moot, or where the court’s resolution of the matter would be purely academic. See Aetna Life Ins. Co., 300 U.S. at 240-41, 57 S.Ct. 461; Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300, 118 S.Ct. 1257, 140 L.Ed.2d 406 (1998).\nPeerless claims that there is no actual controversy in this case because the Contract has been terminated and the parties have since entered into a new' agreement which does not contain the provision in dispute here. However, the fact that the Contract is no longer in effect does not render the parties’ case moot or hypothetical as Peerless seems to suggest. To the contrary, the parties hotly contest their rights and remedies under the Contract and the significance of the IDT Decision relative to those rights and remedies. The issues raised in this case are undoubtedly ripe and form an active controversy.\nAs to whether Blitz’ declaratory judgment claim is duplicative of other claims it alleges,. this is not a basis-for denying declaratory relief. It is well-established that “[t]he existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude a-declaratory judgment that is otherwise appropriate.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 57. To.be, sure, declaratory relief may be awarded cumulatively to other relief which provides the same remedy. See Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 518, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969) (“[A} request for declaratory relief may be considered independently of whether other forms Of relief are appropriate.”). Accordingly, ‘ Peerless will be denied summary judgment. on these grounds.\nD. Blitz’ Motion for Summary Judgment on Count III ,\nBlitz also moves for summary judgment on its declaratory-.judgment claim. (Doc. 55, pp. 10-22), As stated above, the Declaratory Judgment Act allows a district court to declare the legal rights and obligations of parties to an actual controversy. Although the power to render a declaratory judgment is discretionary, a court should have a good reason for declining to consider a declaratory judgment claim. See Angora Enters., Inc. v. Condo. Ass’n of Lakeside Vill., Inc., 796 F.2d 384, 387 (11th Cir.1986) (per curiam). Indeed, courts should confront the merits of a declaratory judgment claim if declaratory relief would (1) “serve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling thé legal relations in issue,” and (2) “terminate and afford relief from the uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the proceeding.” Volvo Constr. Equip. N. Am., Inc. v. CLM Equip. Co., 386 F.3d 581, 594 (4th Cir.2004); accord Allstate Ins. Co. v. Emp’rs Liab. Assurance Corp., 445 F.2d 1278, 1280 (5th Cir.1971). The Court finds that both of these considerations would be served by addressing one of the declarations Blitz requests in Count III:\nThat the authority upon which Peerless relies for its invocation of the “Changes of Law” provision of the Contract do[es] not warrant invocation of that provision, and do[es] not authorize Peerless to renegotiate or modify the Contract.\n(Doc. 1, p.' 10).\nBlitz argues that, the IDT Decision which Peerless cites as justification for modifying the Contract is insufficient to invoke the Contract’s Change in Lav? provision: (Doc. 55, pp. 12-21). In support, Blitz points to the plain language of the Change in Law provision itself, which allows any party to the Contract to renegotiate or modify the terms of the Contract where “any legislative, regulatory, Judical [sic] or other legal action.. .materially affects the ability of a Party to perform any material obligation under this Agreement.” (Contract § 23). Blitz maintains that not only did the IDT Decision not constitute a change in telecommunications law, the ruling did not affect any “material obligation” owed by Peerless under the Contract in that the IDT Decision did not alter Peerless’ duty to pay co-marketing fees on the revenues it.collected. Blitz therefore concludes that the IDT Decision provided no authority for Peerless to stop paying the contractually required commissions.\nDespite the Court’s conclusion above that the IDT Decision does not constitute “a material change in telecommunications law,” the question Blitz asks in its motion for summary judgment is much different than the question Peerless asked in' its motion and answered by the Court in Section IV.B, supra. Where Peerless asked a question of legal interpretation, Blitz now asks a question of contract interpretation — that is, does the IDT Decision constitute a “Change in Law” according to the terms of the Contract?\nIn interpreting and applying the Contract to the instant dispute, the Court’s first inquiry is whether the Change in Law provision is ambiguous, which is resolved as a matter of law. Berryman Transfer & Storage Co. v. New Prime, Inc., 345 Ill.App.3d 859, 280 Ill. Dec. 764, 802 N.E.2d 1285, 1287 (2004), A contract is ambiguous “when the language used is susceptible to more than one meaning or is obscure in meaning through, indefiniteness of expression.” Shields Pork Plus, Inc. v. Swiss Valley Ag Serv., 329 Ill.App.3d 305, 263 Ill.Dec. 219, 767 N.E.2d 945, 949 (2002) (citations omitted). On the other hand, a contract is unambiguous where the court is able to discern the parties’ intent from the plain and obvious meaning of the contract’s language. MXL Indus., Inc. v. Mulder, 252 Ill.App.3d 18, 191 Ill.Dec. 124, 623 N.E.2d 369, 376-77 (1993). A contract is not ambiguous simply because a party urges that it is. See Paris-Custardo v. Great Am. Ins. Co. of N.Y., 363 Ill.App.3d 824, 300 Ill.Dec. 568, 844 N.E.2d 1011, 1014 (2006). Rather, a contract is ambiguous only where a party shows that its language is reasonably and fairly susceptible to moré than one meaning. Paul B. Eptscope, Ltd. v. Law Offices Of Campbell & Di Vincenzo, 373 Ill.App.3d 384, 311 IllDec. 771, 869 N.E.2d 784, 789 (2007). If a contract is found to be ambiguous, its proper interpretation is a question of fact reserved for the jury. Shields Pork, 263 Ill.Dec. 219, 767 N.E.2d at 949. However, where a contract is unambiguous, the court simply enforces the parties’ intent based on the plain and obvious meaning of the words used. MXL Indus., 191 Ill.Dec. 124, 623 N.E.2d at 376-77.\nHere, the Court finds that the Change in Law provision is unambiguous. That provision defines “Change in Law” to mean “any-legislative, regulatory, Judical [sic] or other legal action that materially affects the ability of a Party to perform any material obligation under this Agreement.” (Contract § 23). Although Peerless contends that the word “material” is ambiguous (Doc. 67, pp. 11-12), Peerless does not disclose its interpretation 'of the word, and -the ’Court does not find that, the word is reasonably capable- of holding more than one meaning based on the context of the Contract. The Court therefore applies the word’s plain and obvious meaning: “[o]f such a nature that knowledge of the item would- affect a person’s decision-making; significant; essential.” See Material (adj.), Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Accordingly, three elements must be satisfied for a party to the Contract to .establish a “Change in Law”: (1) a legislative, regulatory, judicial, or other legal action (2) that materially affects (3) any material obligation under the Contract. Applying the plain meaning of the word “material,” both the effect of and the obligation affected by the asserted judicial or legal action must be significant or essential to the Contract.\nThere .is no genuine dispute that the IDT Decision did not impact “any material obligation” owed by Peerless under the Contract. Blitz shows that the relevant obligation in this lawsuit is Peerless’ agreement to “pay a co-marketing fee at the stated commission structure of-30% to [Blitz] based on collected revenues on InterLata CABS (carrier access billing) charges for Interstate and Intrastate traffic terminating to or associated with .the local telephone numbers comprising a component of the Service provided to [Blitz].” (Contract App. A § 1.1). Blitz’ position is that the IDT Decision had nothing to dp with the payment of co-marketing fees in the telecommunications industry and, consequently, never affected Peerless’ ability to pay co-marketing fees under the Contract.\nIn response, Peerless tries to claim that its obligation to pay co-marketing fees to Blitz was materially affected in that the IDT Decision hindered Peerless’ ability to collect revenues from the traffic . Blitz placed on Peerless’ network. (Doc. 67, pp. 13-Í7; see also Doc. 109, pp. 11-17). Peerless shows that, since the IDT Decision, some carriers that transmitted Blitz prepaid calling card traffic have' refbsed to pay Peerless for its services or have demanded that Peerless refund amounts previously paid. (Doc. 67-1, ¶¶ 15-17). According to Peerless’ President and CEO, John Barnicle, the result has been that Peerless was collecting only 16% of the revenues it collected prior to the IDT Decision. {Id. ¶ 18), Peerless concludes that since its ability to collect has been affected by the IDT Decision, so has its obligation to pay co-marketing fees to Blitz.\nHowever, Peerless’ logic does not follow. The unambiguous language of the Contract does not require Peerless to collect revenues based on the traffic Blitz placed, but to pay co-marketing ■ fees to Blitz based on the traffic Blitz placed. (Contract App. A § 1.1). The collection of revenues is merely the yardstick by which Peerless measures the co-marketing fees it pays. By the terms of the parties’ bargained-for agreement, if Peerless collected no revenues from Blitz’ traffic in a given month, then it would not pay a co-marketing fee to Blitz for that month and would not be in breach of the Contract. Further, the parties’ intent regarding Peerless’ payment of co-marketing fees is clarified in a subsequent provision, which reads, “The intention of this section is that Peerless pays [Blitz] only on collected revenues,” leading to the conclusion that the parties cléarly contemplated that Peerless would pay co-marketing fees to Blitz in proportion to the value of revenues collected. (Contract App. A § 1.3) (emphasis added). Indeed, Peerless’ own admission is that it still collected on Blitz traffic after the IDT Decision, it just happened, that the value of revenues collected was significantly less than what Peerless desired.' {See Doc 67-1, ¶ 18). Simply because Peerless became disenchanted with the value of revenues it collected from third parties after the IDT Decision — and consequently the amount Peerless retained for itself under, the Contract — did not mean that its ability to pay Blitz based on these revenues was affected in any way.\nIn the same vein, Peerless also attempts to raise a genuine factual dispute by asserting that the IDT Decision frustrated its purpose in enterihg into the Contract. Because Peerless was collecting only a fraction of the revenues it anticipated when it executed the Contract with Blitz, Peerless submits that it must be excused from paying the. co-marketing fees. (Doc. 67, pp. 17-20). Under - Illinois law, the doctrine of commercial frustration is an extension of-the defense of impossibility and excuses nonperformance • of • a contractual obligation where there is an unforeseeable event which renders the value of a party’s performance completely or almost .completely meaningless. Illinois-American Water Co. v. City of Peoria, 332 Ill.App.3d 1098, 266 Ill.Dec. 277, 774 N.E.2d 383, 390-91 (2002). However, Peerless raised neither commercial frustration nor impossibility as affirmative defenses to this lawsuit. (See Doc. 30, pp. 19-21). These defenses are therefore not properly before the Court on summary judgment. Cf. Gilmbur v. Gates, McDonald & Co., 382 F.3d 1312, 1314-15 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (holding that a non-movant may not avoid summary judgment by raising, a claim .for- the first time in its summary judgment brief).\nSince Peerless fails to genuinely dispute that the IDT Decision did not impact any significant or essential obligation owed under the Contract, Peerless cannot rely on the IDT Decision as authority to invoke the Change in Law provision. The Court will partially grant summary judgment in Blitz’ favor on Count III and issue the requésted decree.\nE. Count IV: Equitable Accounting\nBoth parties move for summary judgment on Blitz’ equitable accounting claim, in which Blitz requests that an auditor be appointed to examine the parties’ accounts and determine the amount due and owing by Peerless Under the terms of the Contract. (Doc. 1, p. 11). In its motion, Peerless maintains that Blitz fails to state a claim for equitable accounting because there is no fiduciary relationship between the parties, there is an adequate remedy at law, and the questioned transactions are not sufficiently complex to warrant an accounting. (Doc. 109, pp. 9-10). Blitz moves for summary judgment for opposite reasons, affirming that an equitable accounting is necessary to determine the value of co-marketing fees'owed by Peerless under the Contract. (Doc. 55, p. 9).\nTo begin, “an accounting is best understood as a remedy for a cause of action, not as a cause of action in its owii right.” Zaki Kulaibee Establishment v. McFliker, 771 F.3d 1301, 1310 & n. 21 (11th Cir.2014). To be entitled to an equitable accounting, “a party must show either (1) a sufficiently complicated transaction and an inadequate remedy at law or (2) the existence of a fiduciary relationship.” Id. at 1311. Peerless states that the disputed transactions, although voluminous, are relatively straightforward and are calculable by the terms of the Contract. Peerless also suggests that Blitz has an adequate remedy at law in the form of a monetary judgment on its breach of contract claim. Finally, Peerless shows that the Contract explicitly disavows any fiduciary relationship between the parties. (Contract § 10). Accordingly, Peerless carries its initial burden on summary judgment of demonstrating that Blitz is not entitled to the equitable accounting remedy.\nIn response, however, Blitz raises genuine factual disputes as to whether the transactions are sufficiently complicated and whether it has an adequate remedy at law. Accounts are sufficiently complicated to warrant an equitable accounting when a jury would not be reasonably able, based on the time and effort required, to assess the evidence and reach an accurate valúe of the amount owed. See Managed Care Solutions, Inc. v. Essent Healthcare, Inc., 694 F.Supp.2d 1275, 1279-81 (S.D.Fla.2010). Blitz shows that an accurate calculation of the co-marketing fees Peerless allegedly owes would involve verifying call ’records for the traffic Blitz placed on Peerless’ network, reviewing 85,-000 invoices (each of which is over 100 pages in length), and reconciling revenues Peerless refunded to certain companies that disputed whether they owed money to Peerless based on the IDT Decision. (Doc. 115-6, 26:2-16, 39:19-40:2, 64:24-65:2). These tasks are certainly “beyond the-ken of [a] jury trial.” Managed Care, 694 F.Supp.2d, at 1281 (quoting Huebener. v. Chinn, 186 Or. 508, 207 P.2d 1136, 1148 (1949)).\nMoreover, Blitz shows that a judgment on its breach of contract claim may not be obtainable without an accounting, thus precluding an adequate remedy at law. Blitz contends that Peerless has been dilatory and evasive in discovery, especially in producing evidence which would allow Blitz to calculate the co-marketing fees allegedly owed by Peerless. (Doc. 115, p. 9). In order to prevail on a breach of contract claim under Illinois law, Blitz will be required, in part, to prove that it has incurred damages and- that these damages are reasonably measurable and not merely speculative. Kirkpatrick v. Strosberg, 385 Ill.App.3d 119, 323 Ill.Dec. 755, 894 N.E.2d 781, 792 (2008). Without a sufficient accounting, Blitz shows that its damages might be too nebulous to sustain a judgment for breach of contract, leaving-Blitz without a remedy at law. For these reasons', Blitz establishes a genuine dispute that the transactions at issue are sufficiently complicated and that Blitz lacks an adequate remedy at law.\nPeerless’ motion for summary judgment will be granted as to Count IV to the extent Blitz attempts .to statq a claim for equitable accounting, as accounting is not a claim for -relief. Zaki, 771 F.3d at 1310 & n. 21. Count IV will therefore be dismissed and Blitz’ motion for. summary judgment on Count IV will be denied. However, Peerless’ motion will be denied to the extent Peerless seeks to preclude the availability of equitable accounting as a remedy in this case. The Court may order an accounting, if appropriate, upon a finding of liability on Blitz’ breach of contract or quantum meruit claims.\nF. Illegality of the Contract\nLastly, Peerless ends its motion for summary judgment by claiming that the Contract is illegal and contrary, to public policy. (Doc. 109, pp. 17-24). Peerless suggests that the Contract requires' Blitz to provide telecommunications services and that Blitz’ failure to comply with the FCC’s regulatory requirements for telecommunications carriers means that Blitz performed the Contract illegally. As a result, Peerless concludes that the Contract is void and unenforceable.\n“Illinois law provides a defense to the enforcement of a contract if that contract is illegal either as a matter of Illinois or Federal law.” Kim v. Citigroup, Inc., 368 Ill.App.3d 298,. 305 Ill.Dec. 834, 856 N.E.2d 639, 647 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted), A contract is illegal only if the conduct-it contemplates is “clearly contrary to what the constitution, statutes or court decisions have declared,” or if it is “manifestly injurious to the public welfare.” Swavely v. Freeway Ford Truck Sales, Inc., 298 Ill.App.3d 969, 233 Ill.Dec. 80, 700 N.E.2d 181, 187 (1998). The determination of whether a contract is illegal is a question of law. Id.\nAll telecommunications carriers' must obtain certification from the FCC before providing telecommunications services. 47 U.S.C. § 214. Peerless argues that Blitz is, in fact, a telecommunications carrier and that Blitz’ failure to obtain the mandated certification renders the Contract and Blitz’ performance thereof illegal. Blitz vehemently denies that it is a telecommunications carrier subject to FCC certification.\nThe FCC defines “telecommunications carrier” as “any provider of telecommunications services, except that such term does not include aggregators of telecommunications services.” 47 U.S.C. § 153(51). It is understood that “telecommunications service” means telecommunications that are provided on a common carrier basis. V.I. Tel. Corp. v. FCC, 198 F.3d 921, 926-27 (D.C.Cir.1999). Therefore, to be a “telecommunications carrier” requiring certification by the FCC, Blitz must provide telecommunications on a common carrier basis.\nA “common carrier” is “any person engaged as a common carrier for hire.” 47 U.S.C. § 153(11). Due to the lack of instruction afforded by this definition, the FCC has adopted a two-prong test for determining whether an entity is a common carrier. First, a common carrier “undertakes] to carry for all people indifferently.” Nat’l Ass’n of Regulatory Util. Comm’rs v. FCC, 533 F.2d 601, 608 (D,C.Cir.1976) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, an entity is a common carrier if it is either' legally compelled to serve all persons who desire to use its services or, if by the entity’s very nature, it holds itself out as serving all who desire to use its services. Id.; see also Time Warner Cable Info. Servs. (N.C.), LLC v. Duncan, 656 F.Supp.2d 565, 573 (E.D.N.C.2009) (“[T]he primary sine qua non of common carrier status is a quasi-public character — ”). “[A] carrier will not be a common carrier where its practice is to make individualized decisions” as to whom it will render services. Natl Ass’n of Regulatory Util. Comm’rs, 533 F.2d at 608-09.\nAs to this first prong, Peerless fails to carry its burden on summary judgment. Although Peerless goes to great lengths to- explain why it believes Blitz is a telecommunications carrier, the evidence relied on reveals to the contrary. Peerless primarily points to the Contract itself, which contemplates that Blitz will resell Peerless’ telecommunications services to Blitz’ own customers. However, a closer look at the contractual languagé Peerless cites shows that the management and re: sale of the telephone numbers assigned to Blitz by Peerless are Blitz’ exclusive responsibility. (Contract §§ 3.7, 6.1). In other words, Blitz chooses to whom it will resell Peerless’ services, an indication that Blitz is not a common carrier! See Nafl Ass’n of Regulatory Util. Comm’rs, 533 F.2d at 608-09. Further, Peerless refers to a presentation Blitz made to a potential client in order to market its services. (Doc. 109-9). Again, however, this presentation only corroborates that Blitz selects to whom it sells. Peerless ultimately, puts forth no affirmative evidence supporting the conclusion that Blitz “undertakes to carry for all .people indifferently.” Peerless therefore cannot establish that Blitz is a telecommunications carrier and is not entitled to summary judgment on the grounds that the Contract is illegal.\nY.

INTRODUCTION\nThis lawsuit involves a contract dispute between Plaintiff, Blitz Telecom Consulting, LLC (“Blitz”), and Defendant, Peerless Network, Inc. (“Peerless”), over Peerless’ alleged nonpayment of co-marketing fees owed to Blitz for telecommunications traffic Blitz-placed on Peerless’ network. To provide context for the parties’ .dispute, the Court finds it prudent to begin by outlining the general framework of how telecommunications services — most pertinently, telephone services — are provided and paid for in the United States.\nFundamentally, there are two types of telephone traffic: local and long-distance. When a customer wishes to complete a local telephone call, the customer begins by dialing the call through his “originating” local exchange carrier (“LEC”) (i.e., AT&T, Sprint, BellSouth, etc.). The originating LEC then transmits the call- to the call recipient’s “terminating” LEC. The terminating LEC ultimately connects the call to its recipient. In the case of a local call, the originating LEC’s customer pays the originating LEC for initiating the call and the originating LEC pays the terminating LEC for completing the call. This compensation structure is termed “reciprocal compensation.” In re Implementation of the Local Competition Provisions in the Telecomms. Act of 1996, 11 FCC Red. 15499, ¶ 1034 (1996); 47 U.S.C. § 251(b)(5).\nWhen a customer wishes to complete a long-distance call, the customer again begins by dialing the call through his originating LEC. The originating LEC then collaborates with ■ a long-distance interex-change carrier (“IXC”) which facilitates transmission of the call by carrying the call on. its, own network until it reaches the call recipient’s terminating LEC. The terminating LEC then connects the call to its recipient. Instead of reciprocal compensation, the LECs involved in a long-distance call assess an “access charge” to the IXC for the privilege of using the LECs\' physical facilities to connect the- call. The originating -LEC’s customer pays the IXC directly for its services, which in turn pays the access charges imposed by the LECs. Implementation of Local Competition Provisions, 11 FCC Red. 15499, ¶ 1035; see also 47 C.F.R. §§ 69.1-69.5.\nWhere problems are beginning to emerge is with the use of prepaid calling cards to complete long-distance calls. Ordinarily, a customer who wants to make a call with a prepaid calling card begins by dialing a toll-free or an out-of-area “access number” through his originating LEC. This access number allows the\' customer to reach the calling card service provider’s centralized switching platform. The switching platform then transmits the call to the intended recipient. Similar tó a long-distance call, the origináting LEC recognizes the access number as a long-distance number and assesses an access charge to the calling card service provider. The calling card service provider debits against the balance of the customer’s prepaid calling card and pays the access charge imposed by the originating LEC. In re Regulation of Prepaid Calling Card Servs., 21 FCC Rcd. 7290, ¶ 2 (2006); In re AT&T Corp. Petition for Declaratory Ruling Regarding Enhanced Prepaid Calling Card Servs., 20 FCC Red. 4826, ¶¶ 3-5 (2005).\nIncreasingly, prepaid calling card companies are issuing prepaid calling cards bearing access numbers within customers’ local calling areas. For example, such a prepaid calling card purchased by a customer in Miami, Florida would require the customer to dial an access number with a 305 area code. Because the access number is local, the originating LEC through which the customer initiates his long-distance call views the call as local; the originating LEC therefore transmits the call to the access number’s LEC as if it will act as the terminating LEC for a local call. However, the access number’s LEC is actually a switching platform operated by the calling card service provider. The calling card service provider then transmits the call as a long-distance call to the intended recipient. Because the originating LEC only recognizes the call as a local call, the originating LEC — expecting to be paid under the reciprocal compensation structure — never assesses an access charge to the calling card service provider. The result is that the calling card service provider debits against the balance of the customer’s prepaid calling card at the same rate, but never pays any fees to which the originating LEC would normally be entitled had the access number been a toll-free or an out-of-area number.. .\nUnderstandably, originating LECs have sued to recover the avoided access charges. See, e.g., Broadvosx-CLEC, LLC v. AT & T Corp., 98 F.Supp.3d 839 (D.Md. 2015); Dollar Phone Access, Inc. v. AT & T Inc., No. 14-CV-3240 (SLT)(LB), 2015 WL 430286, at *1-3 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 2, 2015). One such lawsuit, Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. IDT Telecom, Inc., No. 3:09-CV-01268-P (N.D.Tex. Mar. 9, 2012) (hereinafter referred to as the “IDT Decision”), finds itself as the focal point of the instant litigation. Initiated in a Texas federal district court, the IDT Decision involved a number of LECs who sought to recover the value of access charges avoided by prepaid calling card service providers. Id. at 2-4. In granting partial summary judgment in favor of the LECs on the issue of liability, the IDT Decision held that all prepaid calling card traffic — no matter where a call originates or terminates — is subject- to access charges which must be paid by the service provider. Id, at 9-13. The case subsequently .settled on the issue of damages. See Dollar Phone, 2015 WL 430286, at *3. As will be revealed shortly, Peerless relies heavily on the IDT Decision to justify its actions in this case.\nII. BACKGROUND\nA. Facts\nBlitz’ business involves purchasing telephone numbers from various telecommunications carriers (such as LECs ancj IXCs) and subsequently marketing and reselling those numbers in bulk, along with other associated services, to companies and telecommunications carriers who offer telephone services to end consumers at a discounted price. (Doc. 55-1, ¶¶ 4-6). Many, but not all, of the companies to which Blitz resells. these telephone numbers are prepaid calling card service .providers. (Id. ¶ 4). Peerless is .a telecommunications carrier whose subsidiaries provide local exchange and interexchange telephone services. (Doc. 67-1, ¶ 2).\nOn November 9,2010, Blitz and Peerless entered into an IP Control Agreement (the “Contract”) whereby Peerless- agreed to assign- telephone numbers to Blitz for a fee. (Contract § 3.5; Contract App. A, p. 1). The Contract contemplates that Blitz would then use these numbers to, place traffic on Peerless’ network either by selling the numbers in bulk to other carriers and prepaid calling card providers, or by originating the traffic : itself. (Contract §§ 3.5, 7.4; Doc. 55-1, ¶ .8; Doc. 67-1, .¶ 4). In exchange, Peerless agreed to pay a 30% commission, to Blitz each month. (Contract App. A § 1.1). This commission,, referred to as the “co-marketing fee,” was calculated based on revenues Peerless collected from certain charges it imposed on the customers and carriers whose traffic Blitz brought to Peerless’ network. (Id.).\nFrom 2010 through approximately May or June 2012, Peerless accounted for and paid the ■ monthly co-marketing fees to Blitz. (Doc. 55-1, ¶ 9; Doc. 67-1, ¶ 9). However, on April 11, 2012, Peerless notified Blitz by mail that it would no longer remit co-marketing fees to Blitz because of the IDT Decision, which became a final order on April 9, 2012. (Doc. 55-3). In its letter to Blitz, Peerless asserted that it was entitled to modify the parties’ agreement pursuant to Section 23 of the Contract, which provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\nIn the event of (a) any legislative, regulatory, Judical [sic] or other legal action that materially affects the ability of a Party to perform any material obligation under this Agreement, or (b) any FCC rule, or (c) the enactment or amendment to any applicable Commission rule, Service Guideline, or Commission order or-arbitration award purporting to apply the provisions of the \'Act\' (individually and collectively “Change in Law”), either Party may, on thirty (30) days’ written notice to the other Party..., require that the affected provision(s) be renegotiated, or that new terms and-conditions be added to this Agreement, if applicable.\n(Contract § 23) (hereinafter referred to as the “Change in Law” provision). It was, and ’remains, Peerless’ contention that the IDT Decision constitutes a Change in Law that materially affected its ability to perform a material obligation under the Contract, thus authorizing \'Peerless to cease paying Blitz co-marketing fees. Blitz disagrees, and the instant litigation ensued.\nB. Procedural History\nBlitz initiated this action on February 24, 2014 by filing a Complaint which alleges four claims for relief: breach of contract,, quantum meruit, declaratory judgment, and equitable accounting. (Doc. 1). On January 5, 2015, Peerless filed its Amended Answer and Affirmative Defenses. (Doc. 30). Peerless additionally alleges two counterclaims against Blitz for breach of contract and quantum meruit arising out of Blitz’ alleged nonpayment for services provided by Peerless under the Contract. (Id. at pp. 21-26). Blitz now moves for summary judgment on Counts III and IV of its Complaint and Peerless moves for summary judgment on all four of Blitz’ claims. •\nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n“The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The party moving for summary judgment must “cit[e] to particular parts of. materials in the record, .including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations..., admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials” to support its position that it is .entitled to summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). “The court need consider only the cited materials,” but may also consider any other material in the record. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3).\nAn issue of. fact is “genuine” only if “a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A fact is “material” if the fact could affect the outcome of the lawsuit under the governing law. Id. The moving party bears the initial burden of identifying those portion^ of the record demonstrating a lack of genuine dispute of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); Hickson Corp. v. N. Crossarm Co., Inc., 357 F.3d 1256, 1260 (11th Cir.2004). If the movant shows “an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party’s case,” the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to demonstrate that there are, in fact, genuine ""disputes of material facts. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548; see also Porter v. Ray, 461 F.3d 1315, 1320 (11th Cir.2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 996, 127 S.Ct. 516, 166 L.Ed.2d 371 (2006).\nTo satisfy its burden, the non-mbving party “must do more than\' simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.” Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). Rather, the non-movant must go beyond the pleadings and “come forward with specific facts showing that thére is a genuine issue for trial.” Id. at 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348 (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 600, 118 S.Ct. 1584, 140 L.Ed.2d 759 (1998) (holding that a non-movant carries its burden on summary judgment only by “identify[ing] affirmative evidence” which creates a genuine dispute of material fact).\nIn determining whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists, the Court must read the evidence and draw all factual inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and must resolve any reasonable doubts in the non-movant’s favor. Shop v. City of Atlanta, Co., 485 F.3d 1130, 1136 (11th. Cir.2007). Summary judgment should only be granted “[wjhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact, to find for the non-moving party.” Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nBlitz moves for summary judgment on Counts III and IV of‘its Complaint, which allege claims for declaratory judgment under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202, and for equitable accounting, respectively. Peerless movés for summary judgment on\' all four of Blitz’ claims. The Court addresses the parties’ arguments in\' the most logical order.\nA. Applicable Law\nAs a preliminary matter, the Court must determine the applicable law for each claim. A\' federal court sitting in diversity applies the-substantive law of the state in Which it sits’. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). The Court will therefore apply Florida láw to Blitz’ quantum meruit and equitable accounting claims. However, due to a choice of law provision contained within the Contract, the Court will apply Illinois law to Blitz’ breach of contract claim. (Contract § 12).\nRegarding Blitz’ declaratory judgment claim,..the Erie Doctrine also requires a federal court sitting in diversity to apply the .substantive law of the state in which it sits to substantive issues raised in a claim brought .pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act. Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Walbrook Ins. Co. 41 F.3d 764, 772-73 (1st Cir.1994). Notwithstanding, where a contractual choice of law provision governs a substantive issue, the Court applies the substantive law chosen by the parties. Thus, the Court will apply -Illinois* substantive law to the extent Blitz seeks declaratory relief relative to its breach-of contract claim.-and Florida substantive law to the extent-Blitz seeks\'declaratory relief relative to its quantum meruit and equitable aecounting.claims.\nB. Whether the IDT Decision Changed Telecommunications Law\nThe crux of Blitz’ breach of contract, quantum meruit, and declaratory judgment claims .is whether Peerless breached the Contract by failing to pay co-marketing fees. To that end, Peerless moves for summary judgment on the narrow issue.of whether the IDT Decision Represents “a material change in telecommunications law.” (Doc. 109, pp. 11, 17). Peerless contends that it does, arguing that the IDT Decision changed telecommunications law by holding that prepaid calling card, service providers, are responsible for paying access charges assessed on calls made through prepaid calling cards, regardless of the routing of the call or where the call originated. In that instance, Peerless asserts that it would no longer be obligated to pay .Blitz the co-marketing fees. (Id. at pp., 14-17). , „\nHowever, it is not possible for the IDT Decision to constitute a change in federal telecommunications law, as district courts “lack authority to render prece-dential decisions” that would bind other parties, other courts, or other judges. Am. Elec. Power Co. v. Connecticut, 564 U.S. 410, 131 S.Ct. 2527, 2540, 180 L.Ed.2d 435 (2011). Indeed, a district court’s power is limited solely to adjudicating the issues before it, binding only those who are-parties to the lawsuit. See id. It is undisputed that the IDT Decision was rendered, by a federal district court in the Northern District of Texas and has not been confirmed or adopted by either the FCC or any court having the authority to create binding precedent on the-parties to this lawsuit. To the extent the IDT Decision could be construed as changing,\' modifying,- adding to, or departing from the state of telecommunications law, it only did\' so relative to the parties of that particular lawsuit. The IDT Decision therefore is not “a material change in -telecommunications law,” and Peerless will be denied summary judgment on that issue.\' - ■\nC. Peerless’ Motion for Summary Judgment on Count III\nNext, the Court examines Peerless’ motion for summary judgment as it relates to Blitz’ declaratory judgment claim. (Doc. 109, pp. 6-8). Peerless raises two threshold issues which it insists preclude the Court from granting the declaratory relief Blitz seeks. First, Peerless asserts that no actual controversy exists between the parties. Second,. Peerless contends that the declaratory relief Blitz seeks is duplicative of the relief requested in its breach of contract and quantum meruit claims.\nThe Declaratory Judgment Act grants to the federal district courts the power to “declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.” 28 U.S.C. § 2201. An essential element for a declaratory, judgment action is the existence of an “actual controversy” between the parties, a term which holds the same meaning as the cases and controversies requirement of Article III to the United States Constitution. Aetna Life Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 239-40, 57 S.Ct. 461, 81 L.Ed. 617 (1937). In that sense, an “actual controversy” exists where “there is a substantial contROversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.” Md. Cas. Co. v. Pac. Coal & Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941). Ordinárily, a controversy is\' not sufficiently immediate or real where the parties’ dispute is only hypothetical and not yet ripe, has been rendered moot, or where the court’s resolution of the matter would be purely academic. See Aetna Life Ins. Co., 300 U.S. at 240-41, 57 S.Ct. 461; Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300, 118 S.Ct. 1257, 140 L.Ed.2d 406 (1998).\nPeerless claims that there is no actual controversy in this case because the Contract has been terminated and the parties have since entered into a new\' agreement which does not contain the provision in dispute here. However, the fact that the Contract is no longer in effect does not render the parties’ case moot or hypothetical as Peerless seems to suggest. To the contrary, the parties hotly contest their rights and remedies under the Contract and the significance of the IDT Decision relative to those rights and remedies. The issues raised in this case are undoubtedly ripe and form an active controversy.\nAs to whether Blitz’ declaratory judgment claim is duplicative of other claims it alleges,. this is not a basis-for denying declaratory relief. It is well-established that “[t]he existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude a-declaratory judgment that is otherwise appropriate.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 57. To.be, sure, declaratory relief may be awarded cumulatively to other relief which provides the same remedy. See Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 518, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969) (“[A} request for declaratory relief may be considered independently of whether other forms Of relief are appropriate.”). Accordingly, ‘ Peerless will be denied summary judgment. on these grounds.\nD. Blitz’ Motion for Summary Judgment on Count III ,\nBlitz also moves for summary judgment on its declaratory-.judgment claim. (Doc. 55, pp. 10-22), As stated above, the Declaratory Judgment Act allows a district court to declare the legal rights and obligations of parties to an actual controversy. Although the power to render a declaratory judgment is discretionary, a court should have a good reason for declining to consider a declaratory judgment claim. See Angora Enters., Inc. v. Condo. Ass’n of Lakeside Vill., Inc., 796 F.2d 384, 387 (11th Cir.1986) (per curiam). Indeed, courts should confront the merits of a declaratory judgment claim if declaratory relief would (1) “serve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling thé legal relations in issue,” and (2) “terminate and afford relief from the uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the proceeding.” Volvo Constr. Equip. N. Am., Inc. v. CLM Equip. Co., 386 F.3d 581, 594 (4th Cir.2004); accord Allstate Ins. Co. v. Emp’rs Liab. Assurance Corp., 445 F.2d 1278, 1280 (5th Cir.1971). The Court finds that both of these considerations would be served by addressing one of the declarations Blitz requests in Count III:\nThat the authority upon which Peerless relies for its invocation of the “Changes of Law” provision of the Contract do[es] not warrant invocation of that provision, and do[es] not authorize Peerless to renegotiate or modify the Contract.\n(Doc. 1, p.\' 10).\nBlitz argues that, the IDT Decision which Peerless cites as justification for modifying the Contract is insufficient to invoke the Contract’s Change in Lav? provision: (Doc. 55, pp. 12-21). In support, Blitz points to the plain language of the Change in Law provision itself, which allows any party to the Contract to renegotiate or modify the terms of the Contract where “any legislative, regulatory, Judical [sic] or other legal action.. .materially affects the ability of a Party to perform any material obligation under this Agreement.” (Contract § 23). Blitz maintains that not only did the IDT Decision not constitute a change in telecommunications law, the ruling did not affect any “material obligation” owed by Peerless under the Contract in that the IDT Decision did not alter Peerless’ duty to pay co-marketing fees on the revenues it.collected. Blitz therefore concludes that the IDT Decision provided no authority for Peerless to stop paying the contractually required commissions.\nDespite the Court’s conclusion above that the IDT Decision does not constitute “a material change in telecommunications law,” the question Blitz asks in its motion for summary judgment is much different than the question Peerless asked in\' its motion and answered by the Court in Section IV.B, supra. Where Peerless asked a question of legal interpretation, Blitz now asks a question of contract interpretation — that is, does the IDT Decision constitute a “Change in Law” according to the terms of the Contract?\nIn interpreting and applying the Contract to the instant dispute, the Court’s first inquiry is whether the Change in Law provision is ambiguous, which is resolved as a matter of law. Berryman Transfer & Storage Co. v. New Prime, Inc., 345 Ill.App.3d 859, 280 Ill. Dec. 764, 802 N.E.2d 1285, 1287 (2004), A contract is ambiguous “when the language used is susceptible to more than one meaning or is obscure in meaning through, indefiniteness of expression.” Shields Pork Plus, Inc. v. Swiss Valley Ag Serv., 329 Ill.App.3d 305, 263 Ill.Dec. 219, 767 N.E.2d 945, 949 (2002) (citations omitted). On the other hand, a contract is unambiguous where the court is able to discern the parties’ intent from the plain and obvious meaning of the contract’s language. MXL Indus., Inc. v. Mulder, 252 Ill.App.3d 18, 191 Ill.Dec. 124, 623 N.E.2d 369, 376-77 (1993). A contract is not ambiguous simply because a party urges that it is. See Paris-Custardo v. Great Am. Ins. Co. of N.Y., 363 Ill.App.3d 824, 300 Ill.Dec. 568, 844 N.E.2d 1011, 1014 (2006). Rather, a contract is ambiguous only where a party shows that its language is reasonably and fairly susceptible to moré than one meaning. Paul B. Eptscope, Ltd. v. Law Offices Of Campbell & Di Vincenzo, 373 Ill.App.3d 384, 311 IllDec. 771, 869 N.E.2d 784, 789 (2007). If a contract is found to be ambiguous, its proper interpretation is a question of fact reserved for the jury. Shields Pork, 263 Ill.Dec. 219, 767 N.E.2d at 949. However, where a contract is unambiguous, the court simply enforces the parties’ intent based on the plain and obvious meaning of the words used. MXL Indus., 191 Ill.Dec. 124, 623 N.E.2d at 376-77.\nHere, the Court finds that the Change in Law provision is unambiguous. That provision defines “Change in Law” to mean “any-legislative, regulatory, Judical [sic] or other legal action that materially affects the ability of a Party to perform any material obligation under this Agreement.” (Contract § 23). Although Peerless contends that the word “material” is ambiguous (Doc. 67, pp. 11-12), Peerless does not disclose its interpretation \'of the word, and -the ’Court does not find that, the word is reasonably capable- of holding more than one meaning based on the context of the Contract. The Court therefore applies the word’s plain and obvious meaning: “[o]f such a nature that knowledge of the item would- affect a person’s decision-making; significant; essential.” See Material (adj.), Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Accordingly, three elements must be satisfied for a party to the Contract to .establish a “Change in Law”: (1) a legislative, regulatory, judicial, or other legal action (2) that materially affects (3) any material obligation under the Contract. Applying the plain meaning of the word “material,” both the effect of and the obligation affected by the asserted judicial or legal action must be significant or essential to the Contract.\nThere .is no genuine dispute that the IDT Decision did not impact “any material obligation” owed by Peerless under the Contract. Blitz shows that the relevant obligation in this lawsuit is Peerless’ agreement to “pay a co-marketing fee at the stated commission structure of-30% to [Blitz] based on collected revenues on InterLata CABS (carrier access billing) charges for Interstate and Intrastate traffic terminating to or associated with .the local telephone numbers comprising a component of the Service provided to [Blitz].” (Contract App. A § 1.1). Blitz’ position is that the IDT Decision had nothing to dp with the payment of co-marketing fees in the telecommunications industry and, consequently, never affected Peerless’ ability to pay co-marketing fees under the Contract.\nIn response, Peerless tries to claim that its obligation to pay co-marketing fees to Blitz was materially affected in that the IDT Decision hindered Peerless’ ability to collect revenues from the traffic . Blitz placed on Peerless’ network. (Doc. 67, pp. 13-Í7; see also Doc. 109, pp. 11-17). Peerless shows that, since the IDT Decision, some carriers that transmitted Blitz prepaid calling card traffic have\' refbsed to pay Peerless for its services or have demanded that Peerless refund amounts previously paid. (Doc. 67-1, ¶¶ 15-17). According to Peerless’ President and CEO, John Barnicle, the result has been that Peerless was collecting only 16% of the revenues it collected prior to the IDT Decision. {Id. ¶ 18), Peerless concludes that since its ability to collect has been affected by the IDT Decision, so has its obligation to pay co-marketing fees to Blitz.\nHowever, Peerless’ logic does not follow. The unambiguous language of the Contract does not require Peerless to collect revenues based on the traffic Blitz placed, but to pay co-marketing ■ fees to Blitz based on the traffic Blitz placed. (Contract App. A § 1.1). The collection of revenues is merely the yardstick by which Peerless measures the co-marketing fees it pays. By the terms of the parties’ bargained-for agreement, if Peerless collected no revenues from Blitz’ traffic in a given month, then it would not pay a co-marketing fee to Blitz for that month and would not be in breach of the Contract. Further, the parties’ intent regarding Peerless’ payment of co-marketing fees is clarified in a subsequent provision, which reads, “The intention of this section is that Peerless pays [Blitz] only on collected revenues,” leading to the conclusion that the parties cléarly contemplated that Peerless would pay co-marketing fees to Blitz in proportion to the value of revenues collected. (Contract App. A § 1.3) (emphasis added). Indeed, Peerless’ own admission is that it still collected on Blitz traffic after the IDT Decision, it just happened, that the value of revenues collected was significantly less than what Peerless desired.\' {See Doc 67-1, ¶ 18). Simply because Peerless became disenchanted with the value of revenues it collected from third parties after the IDT Decision — and consequently the amount Peerless retained for itself under, the Contract — did not mean that its ability to pay Blitz based on these revenues was affected in any way.\nIn the same vein, Peerless also attempts to raise a genuine factual dispute by asserting that the IDT Decision frustrated its purpose in enterihg into the Contract. Because Peerless was collecting only a fraction of the revenues it anticipated when it executed the Contract with Blitz, Peerless submits that it must be excused from paying the. co-marketing fees. (Doc. 67, pp. 17-20). Under - Illinois law, the doctrine of commercial frustration is an extension of-the defense of impossibility and excuses nonperformance • of • a contractual obligation where there is an unforeseeable event which renders the value of a party’s performance completely or almost .completely meaningless. Illinois-American Water Co. v. City of Peoria, 332 Ill.App.3d 1098, 266 Ill.Dec. 277, 774 N.E.2d 383, 390-91 (2002). However, Peerless raised neither commercial frustration nor impossibility as affirmative defenses to this lawsuit. (See Doc. 30, pp. 19-21). These defenses are therefore not properly before the Court on summary judgment. Cf. Gilmbur v. Gates, McDonald & Co., 382 F.3d 1312, 1314-15 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (holding that a non-movant may not avoid summary judgment by raising, a claim .for- the first time in its summary judgment brief).\nSince Peerless fails to genuinely dispute that the IDT Decision did not impact any significant or essential obligation owed under the Contract, Peerless cannot rely on the IDT Decision as authority to invoke the Change in Law provision. The Court will partially grant summary judgment in Blitz’ favor on Count III and issue the requésted decree.\nE. Count IV: Equitable Accounting\nBoth parties move for summary judgment on Blitz’ equitable accounting claim, in which Blitz requests that an auditor be appointed to examine the parties’ accounts and determine the amount due and owing by Peerless Under the terms of the Contract. (Doc. 1, p. 11). In its motion, Peerless maintains that Blitz fails to state a claim for equitable accounting because there is no fiduciary relationship between the parties, there is an adequate remedy at law, and the questioned transactions are not sufficiently complex to warrant an accounting. (Doc. 109, pp. 9-10). Blitz moves for summary judgment for opposite reasons, affirming that an equitable accounting is necessary to determine the value of co-marketing fees\'owed by Peerless under the Contract. (Doc. 55, p. 9).\nTo begin, “an accounting is best understood as a remedy for a cause of action, not as a cause of action in its owii right.” Zaki Kulaibee Establishment v. McFliker, 771 F.3d 1301, 1310 & n. 21 (11th Cir.2014). To be entitled to an equitable accounting, “a party must show either (1) a sufficiently complicated transaction and an inadequate remedy at law or (2) the existence of a fiduciary relationship.” Id. at 1311. Peerless states that the disputed transactions, although voluminous, are relatively straightforward and are calculable by the terms of the Contract. Peerless also suggests that Blitz has an adequate remedy at law in the form of a monetary judgment on its breach of contract claim. Finally, Peerless shows that the Contract explicitly disavows any fiduciary relationship between the parties. (Contract § 10). Accordingly, Peerless carries its initial burden on summary judgment of demonstrating that Blitz is not entitled to the equitable accounting remedy.\nIn response, however, Blitz raises genuine factual disputes as to whether the transactions are sufficiently complicated and whether it has an adequate remedy at law. Accounts are sufficiently complicated to warrant an equitable accounting when a jury would not be reasonably able, based on the time and effort required, to assess the evidence and reach an accurate valúe of the amount owed. See Managed Care Solutions, Inc. v. Essent Healthcare, Inc., 694 F.Supp.2d 1275, 1279-81 (S.D.Fla.2010). Blitz shows that an accurate calculation of the co-marketing fees Peerless allegedly owes would involve verifying call ’records for the traffic Blitz placed on Peerless’ network, reviewing 85,-000 invoices (each of which is over 100 pages in length), and reconciling revenues Peerless refunded to certain companies that disputed whether they owed money to Peerless based on the IDT Decision. (Doc. 115-6, 26:2-16, 39:19-40:2, 64:24-65:2). These tasks are certainly “beyond the-ken of [a] jury trial.” Managed Care, 694 F.Supp.2d, at 1281 (quoting Huebener. v. Chinn, 186 Or. 508, 207 P.2d 1136, 1148 (1949)).\nMoreover, Blitz shows that a judgment on its breach of contract claim may not be obtainable without an accounting, thus precluding an adequate remedy at law. Blitz contends that Peerless has been dilatory and evasive in discovery, especially in producing evidence which would allow Blitz to calculate the co-marketing fees allegedly owed by Peerless. (Doc. 115, p. 9). In order to prevail on a breach of contract claim under Illinois law, Blitz will be required, in part, to prove that it has incurred damages and- that these damages are reasonably measurable and not merely speculative. Kirkpatrick v. Strosberg, 385 Ill.App.3d 119, 323 Ill.Dec. 755, 894 N.E.2d 781, 792 (2008). Without a sufficient accounting, Blitz shows that its damages might be too nebulous to sustain a judgment for breach of contract, leaving-Blitz without a remedy at law. For these reasons\', Blitz establishes a genuine dispute that the transactions at issue are sufficiently complicated and that Blitz lacks an adequate remedy at law.\nPeerless’ motion for summary judgment will be granted as to Count IV to the extent Blitz attempts .to statq a claim for equitable accounting, as accounting is not a claim for -relief. Zaki, 771 F.3d at 1310 & n. 21. Count IV will therefore be dismissed and Blitz’ motion for. summary judgment on Count IV will be denied. However, Peerless’ motion will be denied to the extent Peerless seeks to preclude the availability of equitable accounting as a remedy in this case. The Court may order an accounting, if appropriate, upon a finding of liability on Blitz’ breach of contract or quantum meruit claims.\nF. Illegality of the Contract\nLastly, Peerless ends its motion for summary judgment by claiming that the Contract is illegal and contrary, to public policy. (Doc. 109, pp. 17-24). Peerless suggests that the Contract requires\' Blitz to provide telecommunications services and that Blitz’ failure to comply with the FCC’s regulatory requirements for telecommunications carriers means that Blitz performed the Contract illegally. As a result, Peerless concludes that the Contract is void and unenforceable.\n“Illinois law provides a defense to the enforcement of a contract if that contract is illegal either as a matter of Illinois or Federal law.” Kim v. Citigroup, Inc., 368 Ill.App.3d 298,. 305 Ill.Dec. 834, 856 N.E.2d 639, 647 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted), A contract is illegal only if the conduct-it contemplates is “clearly contrary to what the constitution, statutes or court decisions have declared,” or if it is “manifestly injurious to the public welfare.” Swavely v. Freeway Ford Truck Sales, Inc., 298 Ill.App.3d 969, 233 Ill.Dec. 80, 700 N.E.2d 181, 187 (1998). The determination of whether a contract is illegal is a question of law. Id.\nAll telecommunications carriers\' must obtain certification from the FCC before providing telecommunications services. 47 U.S.C. § 214. Peerless argues that Blitz is, in fact, a telecommunications carrier and that Blitz’ failure to obtain the mandated certification renders the Contract and Blitz’ performance thereof illegal. Blitz vehemently denies that it is a telecommunications carrier subject to FCC certification.\nThe FCC defines “telecommunications carrier” as “any provider of telecommunications services, except that such term does not include aggregators of telecommunications services.” 47 U.S.C. § 153(51). It is understood that “telecommunications service” means telecommunications that are provided on a common carrier basis. V.I. Tel. Corp. v. FCC, 198 F.3d 921, 926-27 (D.C.Cir.1999). Therefore, to be a “telecommunications carrier” requiring certification by the FCC, Blitz must provide telecommunications on a common carrier basis.\nA “common carrier” is “any person engaged as a common carrier for hire.” 47 U.S.C. § 153(11). Due to the lack of instruction afforded by this definition, the FCC has adopted a two-prong test for determining whether an entity is a common carrier. First, a common carrier “undertakes] to carry for all people indifferently.” Nat’l Ass’n of Regulatory Util. Comm’rs v. FCC, 533 F.2d 601, 608 (D,C.Cir.1976) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, an entity is a common carrier if it is either\' legally compelled to serve all persons who desire to use its services or, if by the entity’s very nature, it holds itself out as serving all who desire to use its services. Id.; see also Time Warner Cable Info. Servs. (N.C.), LLC v. Duncan, 656 F.Supp.2d 565, 573 (E.D.N.C.2009) (“[T]he primary sine qua non of common carrier status is a quasi-public character — ”). “[A] carrier will not be a common carrier where its practice is to make individualized decisions” as to whom it will render services. Natl Ass’n of Regulatory Util. Comm’rs, 533 F.2d at 608-09.\nAs to this first prong, Peerless fails to carry its burden on summary judgment. Although Peerless goes to great lengths to- explain why it believes Blitz is a telecommunications carrier, the evidence relied on reveals to the contrary. Peerless primarily points to the Contract itself, which contemplates that Blitz will resell Peerless’ telecommunications services to Blitz’ own customers. However, a closer look at the contractual languagé Peerless cites shows that the management and re: sale of the telephone numbers assigned to Blitz by Peerless are Blitz’ exclusive responsibility. (Contract §§ 3.7, 6.1). In other words, Blitz chooses to whom it will resell Peerless’ services, an indication that Blitz is not a common carrier! See Nafl Ass’n of Regulatory Util. Comm’rs, 533 F.2d at 608-09. Further, Peerless refers to a presentation Blitz made to a potential client in order to market its services. (Doc. 109-9). Again, however, this presentation only corroborates that Blitz selects to whom it sells. Peerless ultimately, puts forth no affirmative evidence supporting the conclusion that Blitz “undertakes to carry for all .people indifferently.” Peerless therefore cannot establish that Blitz is a telecommunications carrier and is not entitled to summary judgment on the grounds that the Contract is illegal.\nY. CONCLUSION\nFor the aforementioned reasons, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED:\n1. Plaintiffs Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Counts ,111 and IV of the Complaint (Doc.. 5,5) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as follows:\na. Plaintiffs Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is GRANTED IN PART as to Count III. The Court DECREES bhat the IDT. Decision did not .warrant Defendant’s invocation of the Contract’s Changes in Law provision and did not authorize Defendant to .renegotiate, or modify the Contract.\nb. Plaintiffs Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is DENIED as to Count IV. ■\n2. Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment on Counts I Through IV (Doc. 109) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as follows:\na. Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED to the extent Count IV attempts to state a claim for equitable accounting. Count IV is DISMISSED.\nb. Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment is otherwise DENIED.\nDONE AND ORDERED in Orlando, Florida on December 21,2015.\n. The Federal Communications Commission (""FCC”) is responsible for regulating the telecommunications industry. See 47 U.S.C. §§ 151, 154(i).\n. The Contract is located at Docket Entry 1-1, Exhibit A.\n. In Bonner v. City of Prichard, Ala., 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent’all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit that were handed down prior to October 1, 1981.\n. To the extent Blitz requests other declaratory relief in its Complaint or in its motion for summary\' judgment, the Court declines to reach these declarations, finding that none would serve a useful purpose. Sec Allstate, 445 F.2d at 1280.\n. The parties shall not construe the Court’s finding that the"" defenses of commercial frustration and impossibility are unavailable to Peerless on summary judgment as a finding that Peerless has waived or forfeited these defenses.\n. Because Peerless fails to make a sufficient showing on the first prong of the FCC’s common carrier test, the Court decline\'s to examine the second prong: that all customers who use Blitz’ services are permitted to ""transmit intelligence of their own design and choosing.” Nat\'l Ass’n of Regulatory Util. Comm’rs, 533 F.2d at 609.\n. As explained in Section IV.E of this Order, the equitable accounting remedy remains available to Blitz.', 'type': 'majority'}]"

R. Civ. P.”) 24(a)(2) by St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Company to intervene in this action as a Plaintiff. St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Company refers t,o itself as “Travelers” but does not explain what relationship, if any, exists between Travelers and St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Company. In any event, the Court will refer to St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Company as “Travelers” or the “Intervenor Plaintiff’ in this decision.\nPresently before the Court are (i) a motion by the Defendant pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), 12(d), and 56 to dismiss the complaint; and (ii) a cross-motion by the Plaintiff pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P, 56 for. summary judgment on its declaratory judgment claim. In addition, Travelers filed a memorandum in support of the Plaintiffs motion and in opposition to the Defendant’s motion.\nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court denies the Defendant’s motion .and grants the Plaintiffs motion. .\nI.BACKGROUND\nUnless otherwise specified, the following facts are drawn from the parties’ Rule 56.1 statements,\nA. The Policy\n1. The Parties\nThe Plaintiff is a New York corporation with its principal place of business locatéd in Farmingdale, New York. (Compl. at ¶ 3.) It is a “unionized electrical contractor.” (Peterson Aff., Dkt. No. 37-1, at ¶'2.)\nThe Defendant is an insurance company with its principal place of business in Billings, Montana. (Compl. at ¶ 4.)\nOn March-14, 20,09, the Defendant issued a Commercial General Liability Policy (the “Policy”) that provided coverage to the Plaintiff for the period March 14, 2009 to March 14, 2010. (Martin Aff., Dkt. No. 46-3, at p. 1.) ' .\n2.The “Named Insured” and Additional “Insureds”\nThe Policy contains policy declarations, a general .policy “form,” and separately signed manuscript policy provisions and endorsements that “delete, modify or expand the coverage provisions.” (Id. at p, 2-3.). .\nSignificantly, the manuscript Policy provisions define the “Named Insured” as the “Member identified on the Declarations of the Policy.” (Id. at p. 9, § 1(E)). The Policy Declarations, in turn, list the Plaintiff as the sole “Member” under the Policy. (Id. at p. 1.) Thus, the Plaintiff is the sole “Named Insured” under the Policy.\nThe Policy further notes:\nThroughout this policy the words ’you’ and ’your’ refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations, and any other person or organization qualifying as a Named Insured under this policy. The words ’we,’ ’us’ and ’our’ refer to the company providing this insurance.\n(Id. at p. 12.)\nIn addition, the Policy provides that “[t]he word ‘insured’ means any person or organization qualifying as such under Section II — Who Is An Insured.” (Id.) Section II of the Policy, in turn, sets forth individuals and entities that are also covered as “insureds” under the Policy. (See id. at p. 21,1 § II.) For example, “executive officers” and “directors” of the Plaintiff are also “insureds” under the Policy “with, respect to their duties ... as officers or directors.” (Id. at p. 21, § II(l)(d).) In addition, the Plaintiffs “employees” and “volunteer workers” are “insureds” under the Policy for “acts within the scope of their employment” subject to certain exceptions not relevant here. (Id. at p. 21, § 11(2).)\n3. The Coverage for Bodily Injury Liability\nThe Policy states that the Defendant will “pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of ‘bodily injury5 ... to which this insurance applies.” (Id. at p. 12, § l(l)(a)). In addition, the Defendant has the “duty to, defend the insured against any ‘suit5 seeking those damages,” (Id.)\n. “Bodily injury” is defined as “bodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person[.]” (Id. at p, 25, § V(3).) “Suit” is defined as “a civil proceeding in which damages because of ‘bodily injury,5 ‘property damage5 or ‘personal and advertising injury5 to which this, insurance applies are alleged.” (Id. at p. 28, § V(18)).\nThe Policy states that the insurance applies to “bodily injury” if the bodily injury is: (1) “caused by an ’occurrence5 that takes place in the coverage territory”; (2) “occurs during the policy period”; and (3) certain employees of the Plaintiff did not know “prior to the policy period[] that the ’bodily injury5 ... occurred.” (Id. at p. 12, § 1(b).)\nThe Policy also sets a limit of $1,000,000 for each “occurrence” and a $2,000,000 limit in the aggregate for “occurrences” related to “bodily injury” “regardless ■ of the number of: (a) insureds; (b) claims made or ’suits’ brought; [and] (c) persons or organizations making claims or bringing ’suits.’ ” (Id. át p. 2, p. 22, § III(l).)\nAn Endorsement to the Policy also adds, “Any amount otherwise payable under this Policy ... shall be further reduced by any amounts paid or incurred by the [Defendant] in defense of any claim against Named Insured and/or Insured, including amounts paid and incurred, by attorney’s fees, court costs and. litigation expenses.” (Id. at 41.)\n4. The Coverage for Contractual Indemnity Claims\nThe “Supplementary Payments” provision of the Policy states that the Defendant is also obligated .to provide coverage to a third party or indemnitee,; who the Plaintiff has agreed to assume tort liability for as part of an “agreement pertaining to its business,” see id. at p. 20, p. 26, § V(9).\nHowever, Endorsement 1 states that the “Supplementary Payments” provision . is “hereby deleted from the ISO Commercial General.Liability.” (Id. at p, 53.)\nEndorsement 23 appears to replace the “Supplementary Payments” provision with respect to “contractual indemnity” claims. It provides:\nNotwithstanding the limit of coverage showing the Declarations and/or Section III of this policy ,, $10,000 only is the most we will pay as damages for any and all claims, including any claim for contractual indemnification, arising from or related to any ‘bodily injury’; ‘property damage’ or ‘personal injury’ sustained by an employee of an insured while injured, harmed or' damaged in the scope of such employment.\nIn any action brought:by such employee, if you are impleaded into said action, or if any third party action over .[sic] is commenced against you, irrespective of the claims or theories set forth therein, the $10,000 limit of coverage as provided in this, endorsement shall apply when:\n1. The injury sustained by the employee is a ’grave’ injury’ [sic] as defined by Section 11 of the New York State Workers’ Compensation law ...; and\n2. You are required by contract, regulation or law to be insured under a workers’ compensation policy providing liability coverage for claims arising from injuries to employees.\n(Id. at p. 74) (emphasis in original).\nIn addition, a footnote to Endorsement 23 defines “We” and “our” as the “company providing insurance,” and “You” and “Your” as the “Named Insured showing in the Declarations, and any other person or organization qualifying as a Named Insured under this policy.” (Id., n. 4, 5.)\nB. The Underlying Action\nOn October 28, 2008, the Plaintiff entered into a subcontract (the “Subcontract”) with non-party Getronics USA Inc. (“Getronics”) pursuant to which Getronics hired the Plaintiff to perform electronic services at the Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market located at Exterior Street and River Avenue in Bronx, New York (“Gateway Center”). (See Martin Aff., Dkt. No. 46, Exs. A, E.)\nOn March 19, 2009, Anthony Balzano (“Balzano”), an employee of the Plaintiff, was injured while “dressing electrical cable at the Gateway Center” after he allegedly fell from a “hi low lift.” (Martin Aff., Dkt. No. 46, Ex. B, at 3.) As a result of the fall, he allegedly suffered “injuries to his right shoulder, face, right arm and right leg.” (Compl., Ex. D.)\nOn August 7, 2009, Balzano filed a verified complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of State of New York, Bronx County (the “Balzano Action”) against (i) BTM Development Partners, LLC (“BTM”), which owned the Gateway Center; (ii) Target Corporation (“Target”), which leased the premises where Balzano was working when he was injured; and (iii) Plaza Construction Corp. (“Plaza”), which was the general contractor managing construction at the site (collectively, the “Original Bal-zano Defendants”). (Martin Aff., Dkt. No. 46, Ex. E, at ¶¶ 9-16.) The verified complaint asserted claims against the Original Balzano Defendants for negligence and violation of New York Labor Law § 240 for failing to provide proper safety equipment to construction workers working on the site. (See id. at ¶¶ 26-35.)\nOn February 15, 2010, Target filed a third-party complaint against the Plaintiff alleging breach of contract and seeking indemnification and contribution from the Plaintiff for the Balzano Action. (See Compl., Ex. C.)\nSubsequently, the Plaintiff sent timely notice of the third-party complaint to the Defendant and requested coverage under the Policy. On March 12, 2010, the Defendant sent a letter to the Plaintiff disclaiming coverage because Balzano was an employee of the Plaintiff at the time of his accident. Therefore, the Defendant contended that the “Employer’s Liability” exclusion applied and barred coverage to the Plaintiff in defending the Balzano Action. (See Compl., Ex. D.)\nOn August 23, 2010, the Plaintiff filed an action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Suffolk County against the Defendant seeking a declaratory judgment under the Policy that it was entitled to coverage for the Balzano Action (the “Suffolk Declaratory Action”). (See Compl., Ex. E.)\nOn an unspecified date, the Plaintiff moved for summary judgment in the Bal-zano Action to dismiss Target’s third-party claim against it. (See Compl., Ex. F.) On March 7, 2011, the court in the Balzano Action granted summary judgment dismissing the claims by Target against the Plaintiff. (See Compl. at ¶ 14.) Although not stated explicitly in the parties’ papers, it appears that the Plaintiff-and the Defendant stipulated to dismiss the Suffolk Declaratory Action because all of the claims against the Plaintiff in the Balzano Action had been dismissed.\nOn March 17, 2011, Plaza filed a third-party complaint against Getronies for negligence and breach of . contract. (See Compl., Ex. G, at ¶ 6.) At the time of the March 19, • 2009 accident, Getronies was insured under a Commercial General Liability insurance policy issued by-Travelers. (Martin Aff., Dkt. No. 11, at ¶ 7.) Pursuant to that policy, since March 17, 2011, Travelers has been providing counsel to Ge-tronics in the Balzano Action and paying Getronies’ legal fees. (Id.)\nOn July 12, 2011, Getronies filed a third-party complaint against the Plaintiff, asserting claims for negligence and breach of contract, as well as seeking indemnification from the Plaintiff for any liability, damages, and fees incurred in the Balzano Action. (See Compl., Ex. G, Dkt. No. 1-7, at ¶¶ 15,16-18.)\nOn an unspecified date, the Plaintiff notified the Defendant of the third-party complaint filed against it by Getronies and again sought coverage under the Policy for its defense. On January 6, 2012, the Defendant sent a letter to the Plaintiff indicating that Endorsement 23 limited coverage to the Plaintiff in the amount of $10,000. (See Compl., Ex. J.)\nOn June 28, 2012, the Defendant sent a letter to the Plaintiff denying its request for reconsideration and re-affirming its determination that Endorsement 23' limits the amount that the Defendant' is required to indemnify the Plaintiff for “damages” and “legal expenses” in the Balzano Action to $10,000. (See Compl., Ex. K.) However, the Plaintiff indicated in the letter that it intended to cover the Plaintiff’s defense costs but not. Getronies’ defense costs in the Balzano Action subject to its reservation of rights. (See id.)\nThereafter, the parties in the Balzano Action made motions and cross-motions for summary judgment.\nOn September 14, 2014, New York Supreme Court Justice Kenneth L. Thompson, Jr. rendered a decision granting Ge-tronics’ motion for - summary judgment (i) dismissing Plaza’s third party claims against it; and (ii) awarding judgment to Getronies on its third-party indemnification claim against the Plaintiff. (See Martin Aff., Dkt. No:. 46, Ex. B, 8-9.)\nOn November 24, 2014, Travelers, which, as noted, had been providing a defense to Getronies, sent a letter to the Plaintiff and the Defendant demanding that (i) the Plaintiff take over Getronies’ defense in the Balzano Action and (ii) reimburse all reasonable, defense costs incurred to date by Travelers in defending Getronies in the Balzano Action. (See Martin Aff., Dkt. No.'11, Ex. E.)\nIn a December 1, 2014 letter to Travelers, the Plaintiff directed Travelers to seek indemnification from the Defendant, which it contended was obligated to pay Getron-ics’ legal fees under the Policy. (See Martin Aff., Dkt. No. 11, Ex. F.)\nAccording to Travelers, the Defendant never responded to its November 24, 2014 letter.\nC. The Instant Action\nAs noted on September' 6, 2014, the Plaintiff initiated this action against the Defendant seeking a declaratory judgment that the Policy “obligates [the Defendant] to defend and indemnify [the] [P]laintiff in the underlying action brought by Anthony Balzano and third-party action brought by Getronies [ ] to the extent of the one million dollar ... policy limit” and “[a]n award of costs and expenses of this action together with reasonable attorneys’ fees and expert fees[.]” (Compl. at ¶ 24.)\nOn September 24,. 2015, the Court rendered a decision granting Travelers’ motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2) to intervene in this action.\nOn October 7, 2015, Travelers filed an Intervenor complaint seeking a declaratory judgment stating that (i) “Getronics’ judgment of contractual indemnity owed to it by [the Plaintiff] is a covered loss under the [Defendant’s] Policy”; (ii) the Defendant is “required to pay 100% of the past defense and future indemnity costs associated with the claims brought in the Balza-no Lawsuit against Getronics”; and (iii) the Defendant is “liable to Travelers for any and'all damages Travelers incurs by virtue of [the Defendant’s] breach of its insurance, contractual and common law obligations.” (The Intervenor’s Compl. at ¶ 41.)\nPresently before the Court is (i) the Defendant’s motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Fed. R. 'Civ. P. 12(b)(6), 12(d), and 56; and (ii) the Plaintiffs cross motion for summary judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.\nII. DISCUSSION\nA. Legal Standards\n1. The Defendant’s Motion\nThe Defendant styles its present motion as a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. 12(b)(6) and in the alternative, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d) and 56.\n“In adjudicating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a district court must confine its consideration ‘to facts stated on the face of the complaint, in documents appended to the complaint or incorporated in the complaint by reference, and to matters of which judicial notice may be taken.’” Leonard F. v. Israel Disc. Bank of New York, 199 F.3d 99, 107 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting Allen v. WestPoint-Pepperell, Inc., 945 F.2d 40, 44 (2d Cir.1991)).\nHowever, Rule 12(d) gives the court discretion to convert a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss to a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment when the parties present matters to the Court outside the pleadings, and the parties are “given, the reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.” With respect to this latter notice requirement, the. Second Circuit has stated that “[t]he essential inquiry is whether the appellant should reasonably have recognized the possibility that the motion might be converted into one for summary judgment or was taken by surprise and. deprived of a reasonable opportunity to meet facts outside the pleadings.” In re G. & A. Books, Inc., 770 F.2d 288, 295 (2d Cir.1985).\nIn that:regard, “’[a] party cannot complain of lack of a reasonable opportunity to present all material relevant to a motion for summary judgment when both parties have filed-exhibits, affidavits, counter-affidavits, depositions, etc. in support of and in opposition to a motion to dismiss.’,” Sahu v. Union Carbide Corp., 548 F.3d 59, 67 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting G. & A Books, 770 F.2d at 295) (alteration in original). Indeed, “[e]ven where only the party moving to dismiss has submitted extrinsic material such as depositions or affidavits, the opposing party may be deemed to have had adequate notice that the motion to dismiss would be converted.” Id. (quoting G. & A. Books, 770 F.2d at 295) (alteration added). . ,\nIn addition, where the party ■ opposing the Rule 12(b)(6) motion files a cross-motion for- summary judgment, courts have also held that the movant has adequate notice that his or her Rule 12(b)(6) motion may be converted to a motion for summary judgment. See Green Tree Servicing LLC v. Christodoulakis, No. 14-CV-2037 (SJF) (AYS), 136 F.Supp.3d 415, 433, 2015 WL 5719808, at *15 n. 2 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2015) (“[Sjince— the parties were afforded a reasonable ■ opportunity to present materials outside the pleadings and, in fact, submitted such materials in support of, and in opposition to, plaintiffs cross motion for summary judgment, I need not exclude the extrinsic, evidence from my consideration of defendants’ motion .under Rule 12(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.”); Maecker v. Everhome Mortgage Co., No. 13CV305A (HUS), 2014 WL 6673720, at *3 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2014), report and recommendation adopted, No. 13-CV-305, 2014 WL 1270031 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2014) (“Here, the defendant refers to loan documents, that were not attached to the complaint. The plaintiff has also filed a cross-motion for summary judgment ..... Thus, the Court will treat the instant motion as a motion for summary judgment.”).\nHere, in support of its Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Defendant relied for the most part on documents that were attached to and incorporated in the complaint. However, in opposition to the Defendant’s motion, the Plaintiff filed two affidavits by Christian Peterson (“Peterson”), the President of the Plaintiff, and J. Caesar Galarza (“Galarza”), the Plaintiffs counsel, which refer to facts outside of the complaint. (See Galarza Aff., Dkt. No. 37.) Further, the Plaintiff filed a cross-motion for summary judgment and attached a separate affidavit by Galarza that again referred to matters outside of the complaint. (See Galarza Aff., Dkt. No. 38-2.)\nBased on the fact that the Plaintiff filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, the Defendant clearly had the opportunity to provide ■ facts outside the pleadings. Indeed, the Defendant must have recognized the possibility that the Court would convert its Rule- 12(b)(6) motion into a Rule 56 motion given that it moved in the alternative under Rule 12(d) and Rule 56. See Sahu, 548 F.3d at 69 (“A motion called a motion for summary judgment, whether or not stated as alternatively for dismissal, ordinarily will place a plaintiff on notice that the district court is being asked to look beyond the pleadings to the evidence in order to decide the motion.”) (emphasis added); Sabeniano v. Citibank, N.A. New York, No. 12 CIV. 1928 ALC DCF, 2013 WL 1164891, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 20, 2013) (“In fact, Defendant styled its Motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(d), indicating it anticipated conversion.’’ Therefore, the Court will treat the pending motions as cross-motions for summary judgment.).\nAccordingly, the Court will convert the Defendant’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to one under Rule 56. However, the Court notes that regardless of what standard it. applies to the parties’ motions, their dispute centers on the interpretation of Endorsement 23 of the Policy. As explained below, the Court finds that the plain language of Endorsement 23 affords the coverage sought by the Plaintiff in this action. Therefore, the Court does not need to resort to any extrinsic evidence to resolve the parties’ dispute despite the fact that it finds that it is permitted to do so.\n2. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56\nFed. R. Civ.’ P. 56(a) provides that a court may grant summary judgment when the “movant shows there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”\n“Where the moving party demonstrates 'the absence of a genuine issue of material fact,’ Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986), the opposing party must come forward with specific evidence demonstrating the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact.” Brown v. Eli Lilly & Co., 654 F.3d 347, 358 (2d Cir.2011) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).\nIn that regard, a party “must do more than simply show that there is some meta:physical doubt as to the material facts[.]” Id. (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986)). Further, the opposing party “ ‘may not rely on cónclusory allegations or únsubstantíated speculation!)]’ ” F.D.I.C. v. Great Am. Ins. Co., 607 F.3d 288, 292 (2d Cir.2010) (quoting Scotto v. Almenas, 143 F.3d 105, 114 (2d Cir.1998)).\n“Where it is clear that no rational finder of fact ‘could find in favor of the nonmov-ing party because the evidence to support its cáse is so slight,’ summary judgment should be granted.” Id. (quoting Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs., Ltd. P’ship, 22 F.3d 1219, 1224 (2d Cir.1994)).\nB. As to Jurisdiction and Choice of Law\n1. Jurisdiction\nAs an initial matter, the Court notes that the complaint alleges that this Court has jurisdiction over this action based on “28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1332, 1337 and 1343, and has supplemental jurisdiction over [the] Plaintiffs state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391.” (Compl. at ¶ 1.)\nHowever, most of these jurisdictional statutes do not apply to this case.\n28 U.S.C. § 1331 confers federal jurisdiction over “all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.” Here, the Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a) (the “Declaratory Judgment Act”), that it is afforded coverage under the Policy for damages and attorneys’ fees resulting from the Balzano Action up to the general policy limit of $1,000,000. However, the Declaratory Judgment Act does not confer subject matter jurisdiction, and the parties do not raise any federal issue relating to the interpretation of the Policy. See Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v. Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians, 94 F.3d 747, 752 (2d Cir.1996) (“Section 2201 provides no independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction:”); Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. v. Lloyds TSB Gen. Leasing (No. 20) Ltd., 774 F.Supp.2d 431, 437-38 (D.Conn. 2011) (“ ‘[T]he declaratory judgment statute does not confer jurisdiction on a district court,’ and ‘a complaint-' seeking, a declaratory judgment is to be tested, for purposes of the well-pleaded complaint rule, as if the party whose adverse action the declaratory judgment plaintiff apprehends had initiated a lawsuit against the declaratory judgment plaintiff.’ ”) (quoting Fleet Bank, Nat. Ass’n v. Burke, 160 F.3d 883, 885-86 (2d Cir.1998) (alteration in original)). Therefore, the Plaintiffs claim does not “arise” under federal law, and 28 U.S.C. §■ 1331 is not applicable, to this case.\nSimilarly, 28 U.S.C. § 1337, which confers jurisdiction over actions arising under an Act of Congress regulating commerce, and 28 U.S.C. .§ 1343, which confers jurisdiction over actions in which an individual is deprived of his or her civil rights, are clearly not applicable to the Plaintiffs declaratory judgment claim because it is based solely on. the interpretation of an insurance policy and is governed by state law.\nHowever, the Court does have diversity jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332, which confers federal jurisdiction over matters that involve an amount in controversy that exceeds $75,000 .and is- between citizens of different states. “To determine the amount in controversy in a declaratory action premised on diversity jurisdiction, courts look to the ’potential monetary value of the right, or amount of the liability,’ in ’a present or potential coercive action[.]’” Garanti Finansal Kiralama A.S. v. Aqua Marine & Trading Inc., 697 F.3d 59, 68 (2d Cir.2012) (quoting parenthetically Developments in the Law: Declaratory Judgments—1941-1949, 62 Harv. L. Rev. 787, 801 (1949)); see also Am. Standard, Inc. v. Oakfabco, Inc., 498 F.Supp.2d 711, 717 (S.D.N.Y.2007) (“In actions seeking declaratory or injunctive relief, the amount in controversy is measured by the value of the object of the litigation.”).\nHere, the parties are diverse — the Plaintiff is a New York corporation and the Defendant is a Montana insurance group with its principal place of business in Montana. Further, the potential liability to the Defendant is the $1 million limit on coverage set forth in the Policy. Therefore, there is diversity, jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs declaration judgment claim.\n2. Choice of Law\nAs the basis of jurisdiction is diversity of citizenship, the Court must next determine what law to apply in interpreting the Policy.'In that regard, the Plaintiffs chosen forum is New York. Therefore, this Court must apply New York principles in determining the choice of law. See Booking v. Gen. Star Mgmt. Co., 254 F.3d 414, 419 (2d Cir.2001). Under those principles, “ ‘ [t]he first step ... is to determine whether there is an actual conflict between the laws of the jurisdictions ’ involved.’” Schwartz v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 539 F.3d 135, 151 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting. In re Allstate Ins. Co., 81 N.Y.2d 219, 223, 597 N.Y.S.2d 904, 613 N.E.2d 936 (1993) (alteration in original)).\nHere, the Policy contains a choice of law clause selecting Montana law: “This Policy shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Montana.” (Martin Aff., Dkt. No. 46,' Ex. C, at p. 52, § XII.) However, “even when the parties include a choice-of-law clause in their contract, their conduct during litigation may indicate assent to the application of another state’s law.” Cargill, Inc. v. Charles Kowsky Res., Inc., 949 F.2d 51, 55 (2d Cir.1991) (citing Walter E. Heller & Co. v. Video Innovations, Inc., 730 F.2d 50, 52 (2d Cir.1984)).\nFor example, where the parties fail to bring a foreign choice of law clause to the Court’s attention and apply New York law in their briefs, courts have found that the parties consented to the application of New York law and will disregard the foreign choice of law clause. See Walter E. Heller & Co., 730 F.2d at 52 (“Although New York courts generally accord deference to choice-of-law provisions in contracts, ... such provisions are not controlling and may be disregarded where the most significant contacts with the matter in dispute are in another State .... Moreover, in the absence of a strong countervailing public policy, the parties to litigation' may consent by their conduct to the law to be applied.”) (emphasis added).\nHere, the parties do not bring the choice of law clause to the Court’s attention and rely primarily on New York cases in their - legal memoranda. Thus, the parties’ conduct indicates consent to the application of New York law. Further, New York has the strongest relationship to the Plaintiffs claim because the Plaintiff is a New York corporation, the underlying third-party contractual indemnity claim is pending in New York state court, and the Balzano Action arises from a personal injury that took place in New York.'Therefore, the Court will disregard the Montana choice of law provision and will instead apply New York law to interpreting, the Policy. See Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. Flow Int’l Corp., 844 F.Supp.2d 286, 300 (N.D.N.Y.2012) (“‘[E]ven where the parties include a choice of law clause in their contract, their conduct, during litigation may indicate assent to the application of another state’s law,’ and the court may therefore disregard the clause and apply the law to which the parties have assented.”) (quoting Bombardier Capital, Inc. v. Richfield Housing Center, Inc., Nos. 91-CV-750, 91-CV-502, 1994 WL 118294, at *3 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 21, 1994)).\n3. The Applicable New York Law\n“Under New York law, insurance policies are interpreted according to general rules of contract interpretation.” Olin Corp. v. Am. Home Assur. Co., 704 F.3d 89, 98 (2d Cir.2012). Those rules of interpretation require the court “ ’to give effect to the intent of the parties as expressed in the clear language of the contract.’” Ment Bros. Iron Works Co. v. Interstate Fire & Cas. Co., 702 F.3d 118, 122 (2d Cir.2012) (quoting Mount Vernon Fire Ins. Co. v. Belize NY, Inc., 277 F.3d 232, 236 (2d Cir.2002)). Further, the “[t]erms in an insurance contract must be given “’their plain and ordinary meaning.’”” Id. (quoting 10 Ellicott Square Court Corp. v. Mountain Valley Indem. Co., 634 F.3d 112, 119 (2d Cir.2010)).\nAs an initial matter, when deciding a motion for summary judgment, a court must determine whether the disputed language of the policy is ambiguous. See Law Debenture Trust Co. of New York v. Maverick Tube Corp., 595 F.3d 458, 465 (2d Cir.2010) (“Under New York law, which the parties agree is controlling here, the initial question for the court on a motion for summary judgment with respect to a contract claim is ^whether the contract is unambiguous with respect to the question disputed by the parties.’ ”) (quoting International Multifoods Corp. v. Commercial Union Insurance Co., 309 F.3d 76, 83 (2d Cir.2002)).\nContract language is ambiguous when it is “‘capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs, practices, usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.’ ” JA Apparel Corp. v. Abboud, 568 F.3d 390, 396-97 (2d Cir.2009) (quoting Revson v. Cinque & Cinque, P.C., 221 F.3d 59, 66 (2d Cir.2000)).\n“When the question is a contract’s proper construction, summary judgment may be granted when its words convey a definite and precise meaning absent any ambiguity.” Seiden Associates, Inc. v. ANC Holdings, Inc., 959 F.2d 425, 428 (2d Cir. 1992).\nOn the other hand, “[i]f a court concludes a provision in an insurance contract is ambiguous, it may consider extrinsic evidence to ascertain the parties’ intent at the formation of the contract.” Olin Corp., 704 F.3d at 99 (JA Apparel Corp., 568 F.3d at 397). “If the extrinsic evidence fails' to establish the .parties’ intent, courts may apply other rules of contract interpretation, including New York’s rule of contra proferentem, according to which ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the insured.” Id.\nC. As to the Parties’ Cross-Motions\nHere, the Policy provides a $1,000,000 limit per occurrence for claims arising from “bodily injury.” The Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that it is entitled to indemnification up to the $1,000,000 Policy limit for damages and expenses incurred in defending against the third-party 1 contractual indemnification claim brought by Getronics against it in the Balzano Action.\nThe Defendant does not dispute that the claim asserted by Getronics against the Plaintiff in the Balzano Action arises out of a “bodily injury” to Balzano, and is there-; fore, covered under the Policy. However, the Defendant asserts that the language of Endorsement 28 “limits the amount of coverage for [the Plaintiff] in the Underlying Action to $10,000.” (The Def.’s Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. 5-9, at 7.)\nEndorsement 23 provides:\nNotwithstanding the limit of coverage shown in the Declaration and/or Section II of this policy ..., $10,000 only is the most we will pay as damages for any and all claims, including any claim for contractual indemnification, arising from or relating to any ‘bodily injury5 ... sustained by -an employee of an insured while injured, harmed or damages in the scope of such employment.\nIn any action brought by such employee, if you are impleaded into said action, or if any third party action over [sic] is commenced against you, irrespective of the claims or theories set forth therein, the $10,000 limit of coverage as provided in this endorsement shall apply when:\n1. The injury sustained by the employee is a ‘grave injury’ as defined by Section 11 of the New York State Workers’ Compensation Law, as fol- . lows:\n• Death\n• Permanent and total loss or use or amputation of an arm, leg, hand or foot,\n• Loss of múltiple fingers, '\n• Loss of multiple toes,\n• Paraplegia or quadriplegia,\n• Total and permanent blindness,\n• Total and permanent deafness,\n• Loss of nose,\n• Loss of ear,\n• Permanent and severe facial disfigurement,\n• Loss of an index finger; or\n■ • An acquired injury to the brain caused by an external physical force . resulting in total permanent disability; and\n2. You are required by contract, regulation or law to be insured under a workers’ compensation policy providing liability -coverage for claims arising from injuries to employees.\n(Martin Aff., Ex. C, at p; 74-5) (emphasis in original). In addition, the Endorsement defines the words “we” - and “our” as “the company providing this insurance” and the words “you” and “your” as the “Named Insured shown in the declarations, and any other person or organization qualifying as a Named Insured under this [P]olicy.” (Id at p. 74.)\nThe Defendant' relies primarily on the first paragraph of Endorsement 23, which limits the amount that the Defendant will pay in damages to $10,000 for “any and all. claims, including any claim for contractual indemnification, arising from or,relating to any ‘bodily injury’ sustained by an employee of an insured.” (The Def.’s Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. 5-9, at 6-7.)\nIt is undisputed that Balzano was an employee of the Plaintiff; sustained bodily injuries in the course of his employment; and initiated the Balzano- Action seeking damages resulting from his injuries. It is also undisputed that Getronics, who hired the Plaintiff as a sub-contractor on the project, impleaded the Plaintiff into the Balzano Action seeking contractual indemnity. Thus, there is also no dispute that Getronics’ contractual indemnity claim against the Plaintiff “arises from or relates” to Balzano’s injury. Therefore, the Defendant asserts that the first paragraph of “Endorsement 23 clearly and unambiguously limits any obligation under the [Defendant’s] Policy to $10,000” for damages resulting from Getronics’ third-party claim. (The Def.’s Mem. of Law at 6-7.)\nOn the other hand, the Plaintiff asserts that the second paragraph, not the first paragraph, governs the present dispute. Under the second paragraph, “if you are impleaded into said action, or if any third party action over [sic] is commenced against you .... the $10,000 limit of coverage as provided in this endorsement shall apply when -.... [t]he injury sustained by the employee is a ‘grave injury’ as defined by Section 11 of the New York State Workers’ Compensation Law.”\nIt is undisputed that the Plaintiff was impleaded into the Balzano Action when Getronics filed a' third-party complaint in the Balzano Action against the Plaintiff seeking, among other things, contractual indemnity under the Subcontract. (See Compl., Ex. G.)\nFurther, the Plaintiff claims that it is also undisputed that Balzano did not suffer a “grave injury” as defined by the New York State Workers’ Compensation Law. (See the PL’s Repy Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. 41, at ¶ 9; the Intervenor PL’s Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. 45, at p. 9-10.)\nThe Defendant does not appear to dispute this statement in its memorandum of law, nor does it file a Local Civil Rule 56.1 statement. Also, there is no evidence in the record suggesting that Balzano suffered a “grave injury” under New York State Workers’ Compensation Law. (See Martin Aff., Ex. C, at p. 74-5.) Indeed, according to the Defendant’s own account of Balza-no’s injury set forth in its March 12, 2010 coverage letter to the Plaintiff, Balzano “sustained injuries to his right shoulder, face, right arm.and right leg” as a result of falling from a lift on the job site. (See Compl., Ex. D.) Nowhere in this letter, nor in Balzano’s underlying state complaint, is it alleged that Balzano’s leg, shoulder, or arm had to be amputated as a result of his injuries, or that he suffered “permanent and severe facial disfigurement.” Accordingly, the Court agrees with the Plaintiff that it is undisputed for purposes of this motion that Balzano did not suffer a “grave injury” under New York State Workers’ Compensation Law.\nThus, the Plaintiff asserts that under the plain language of the second paragraph of Endorsement 23, the coverage afforded to him is not limited to $10,000 but is rather subject to the general policy limit of $1,000,000 for all claims relating to “bodily injury.” (See the PL’s Mem. of Law at 3.) .\nIn addition, the Intervenor Plaintiff filed a legal memorandum concurring with the Plaintiffs interpretation of Endorsement 23 and asserting that the Court should reject the Defendant’s reading of the Endorsement. (The Intervenor PL’s Mem. of Law at 2-3.)\nThe Court finds that the plain language of Endorsement 23 and the canons of contract iiiterpretation support the interpretation offered by the Plaintiff, and therefore, the ;Court need not reach the- parole evidence offered by the Plaintiff.\nThe first paragraph of Endorsement 23 states, “$10,000 only is the most we will pay as damages for any and all claims, including any claim for contractual indemnification, arising from or belated to any ‘bodily injury5 ... sustained by an employee of an insured while injured, harmed, or damages in the scope of such employment.” (Martin Aff., Ex. C, at p. 74-5) (emphasis added).\nThe second paragraph of Endorsement 23 states, “In any action brought by such, employee if You are impleaded into said action or if any third party action ... is commenced against You, irrespective of the claims or theories set forth therein, the $10,000 limit of coverage as provided shall apply when ... the injury sustained by-the employee is a ‘grave injury” as defined by Section -11 of the New York -State Workers’ Compensation Law.” (Id.) (emphasis added). As noted, a footnote to the Endorsement states that, “[t]he words ‘you’ and ‘your’ refer to the Named Insured shown in the declaration, any other person or organization qualifying as a Named Insured under this policy.” (Id.) (emphasis added).\nThus, the plain language of the first paragraph refers only to claims “arising from ... any ‘bodily injury1 .,. sustained by an employee of an insured”; while the second paragraph refers to actions where “You” — meaning the Named Insured — is impleaded into the action or third party actions commenced against ‘You” — meaning the Named Insured.”\nThat distinction is critical because the Policy defines the “Named Insured”- and “an insured” differently. The “Named Insured” is defined as “the Member identified on- the Declaration of the Policy.” (Martin Aff., Ex. C, at p. 9.) The Plaintiff is the only “Member” identified in the Policy Declarations, and therefore, is the sole “Named Insured,” under, the Policy. (Id. at p. 2.)\nOn the other hand, an “insured”.is defined by Section II of the Policy as referring to individuals associated with the Plaintiff, such' as the Plaintiff’s “executive officers,” “directors,” “shareholders,” “volunteer workers,” and “employees.” (Martin Aff., Ex. C, at p. 21, § II(l)(d).)\nThis distinction is made clear in the first paragraph of the Policy which states, “Throughout this policy the words ‘you’ and ‘your’ refer to the Named Insured showing the Policy Declarations. ..... The word ‘insured’ means any person or organization qualifying as such under Section II — Who Is An Insured.” (Id. at p. 12.) As the Intervenor. Plaintiff correctly notes, the distinction between the “Named Insured” and an “Insured” is also carried through in other sections of the Policy. For example, an Endorsement to the Policy setting forth the “Aggregate Limit” on coverage repeatedly refers to the “Named Insured” and an “Insured” separately: “In other words, if the [Defendant] pays a elaim(s) which coverage is provided to a Named Insured and/or Insured in an amount equal to the Aggregate limit ... the [Defendant] shall not have any further liability under the Policy”; “Any amount otherwise payable under this Policy including the Per Occurrence Limit or Aggregate Limit shall be further reduced by any amount paid or incurred by the [Defendant] in defense of any claim against any Named Insured and/or Insured”; and “Any Named Insured and/or Insured making a claim must give the [Defendant] notice in writing of any claim within sixth (60) days ... after it is unknown to any Named Insured and/or Insured during the Term.” (Id. at p. 41-42) (emphasis added).\nTherefore, it is clear from the Policy language that the “Named Insured” and the “Insured”- refer to different entities. Applying these definitions, the first paragraph of Endorsement 23, which limits coverage -to ■ $10,000 in damages “for any and all claims, including any claim for contractual .indemnification, arising from or. relating to any ’bodily injury’ ... sustained by an employee of an insured,” applies to claims against the Plaintiffs executive officers,' directors, shareholders, employees, and volunteer workers. On the other hand, the second paragraph applies to actions- where “You” — meaning the “Named Insured,” which refers1 solély to the Plaintiff — is impleaded into the action or a third party action is commenced against “You” — again referring to the “Named Insured,” meaning the Plaintiff-— and the injury sustained by the Plaintiffs employee is a “grave injury.”\nThe Court finds that this reading of Endorsement 23, which is favored by the Plaintiff, gives effect to both the first and second paragraphs of the Endorsement and is consistent with the Policy as a whole. Promuto v. Waste Mgmt., Inc., 44 F.Supp.2d 628, 650 (S.D.N.Y.1999) (“The Court must read the indemnification provision in ’ conjunction with all other provisions in the agreement to avoid inconsistencies or an interpretation which would render another provision superfluous or without effect.”).\nOn the other hand, the Defendant asks the Court to read the first paragraph of Endorsement 23 as applying a limit of $10,000 for coverage over any claims arising out of a “bodily injury” to an employee regardless of whether those claims were brought against an “insured” or the “Named Insured.” Such a reading ignores the distinction established by the Policy between “an insured” and the-“Named Insured.” It also renders the second paragraph meaningless because if, as the Defendant contends, the first paragraph-was intended to limit coverage under the Policy to “any claims” brought by employees against an “insured” and the1 “Named Insured,” then there would be no need to include the second paragraph of the En-, dorsement specifying that the $10,000 limit on ■ damages applies to claims - brought against the Named Insured that involve a “grave injury.”\nTherefore, -the Court declines' to adopt the Defendant’s interpretation because it ignores the plain language of the Policy, is inconsistent with the Policy as a whole, and renders., the second paragraph of the Policy superfluous. See LaSalle Bank Nat. Ass’n v. Nomura Asset Capital Corp., 424 F.3d 195, 206 (2d Cir.2005) (“‘[A]n interpretation of a contract that has ‘the effect of rendering at least one clause superfluous or 'meaningless ... is not preferred and will be ayoided if possible.’ ”); Travelers Indem. Co. of Ill. v. F & S London Pub, Inc., 270 F.Supp.2d 330, 334 (E.D.N.Y.2003) (rejecting an interpretation of an insurance policy because “Paragraph 4 of the Lease would be rendered meaningless if the indemnity clauses were read to encompass any and all damage to the Property, regardless of fault.”)\nApplying the Plaintiff’s reading of Endorsement 23 to the facts of this case, it is clear that the Endorsement does not limit coverage to the Plaintiff for the Balzano Action. That is because, as noted above, it is undisputed that -Getronies impleaded the Plaintiff, -which is -the “Named Insured,” into the Balzano Action, and Balzano does not allege that he suffered a “grave injury” under New York State Workers’ Compensation Law. Thus, under the plain- language . of the second paragraph of Endorsement 23 the coverage afforded to the Plaintiff in the Balzano Action is, not limited to $10,000. Instead, the Plaintiff is entitled to coverage up to the $1,000,000 general policy-limit for actions arising from “bodily injury.”\nTherefore, the Court finds that the Plaintiff >is entitled to -a judgment, stating that the Defendant is- required to “defend and indemnify [the] [P]laintiff in the underlying action brought by Anthony Balza-no and [the] third-party action brought by Getronies USA .to the extent- of the one million dollar. ($1,000,000) policy limit.” (See Compl. at ¶ 24.) Accordingly, the Court grants the Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and denies the Defendant’s motion to dismiss.\nThe Court notes that the Intervenors have also filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment stating that (i) “Ge-tronies’ judgment of contractual indemnity owed to it by the Plaintiff is a ‘covered loss’ under the Defendant’s Policy”; (ii) the Defendant is ‘Required to. pay 100% of the past defense and future indemnity costs associated with the claims brought in the Balzano Lawsuit against Getronics”; and (iii) the Défendant is “liable to [the Inter-venor Plaintiff] for any and all damages Travelers incurs by virtue of the [Defendant’s] breach of its insurance, contractual and common law obligations.” (The In-ververior Compl. at ¶ 41.)\nThis claim is not the subject of the Plaintiffs present motion for summary judgment and seeks a judgment that has different wording and appears somewhat broader than the declaratory judgment sought by the Plaintiff, However, the Court recognizes that this decision may render the Intervenor Plaintiff’s claim for a declaratory judgment unnecessary because the Court has ruled that the Plaintiff is entitled to, coverage under the Policy for the Balzano Action up to the $1,000,000 general policy limit. Therefore, the Court directs the Intervenor Plaintiff to file a letter on ECF no longer than three pages within five days of the date of this decision regarding the status of its claim in light of. this decision.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Defendant’s motion to dismiss is denied, the Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment is granted, and the Plaintiff is entitled to a declaratory judgment stating that the Defendant is required to “defend and indemnify the Plaintiff in the underlying action brought by Anthony Balzano and the third-party action brought by Getronics USA to the extent of the one million dollar ($1,000,000) policy limit.”\nFurther, the Court directs the Interve-nor Plaintiff to file a letter on ECF within five days of the-date of this decision informing the Court of the status of its claim for a declaratory judgment in light of this decision. -\nSO ORDERED."",""type"":""majority""}],""judges"":[],""head_matter"":""CERTIFIED MULTI-MEDIA SOLUTIONS, LTD., Plaintiff, St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Company, Intervenor Plaintiff, v.

In addition, Travelers filed a memorandum in support of the Plaintiffs motion and in opposition to the Defendant’s motion.\nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court denies the Defendant’s motion .and grants the Plaintiffs motion. .\nI.BACKGROUND\nUnless otherwise specified, the following facts are drawn from the parties’ Rule 56.1 statements,\nA. The Policy\n1. The Parties\nThe Plaintiff is a New York corporation with its principal place of business locatéd in Farmingdale, New York. (Compl. at ¶ 3.) It is a “unionized electrical contractor.” (Peterson Aff., Dkt. No. 37-1, at ¶'2.)\nThe Defendant is an insurance company with its principal place of business in Billings, Montana. (Compl. at ¶ 4.)\nOn March-14, 20,09, the Defendant issued a Commercial General Liability Policy (the “Policy”) that provided coverage to the Plaintiff for the period March 14, 2009 to March 14, 2010. (Martin Aff., Dkt. No. 46-3, at p. 1.) ' .\n2.The “Named Insured” and Additional “Insureds”\nThe Policy contains policy declarations, a general .policy “form,” and separately signed manuscript policy provisions and endorsements that “delete, modify or expand the coverage provisions.” (Id. at p, 2-3.). .\nSignificantly, the manuscript Policy provisions define the “Named Insured” as the “Member identified on the Declarations of the Policy.” (Id. at p. 9, § 1(E)). The Policy Declarations, in turn, list the Plaintiff as the sole “Member” under the Policy. (Id. at p. 1.) Thus, the Plaintiff is the sole “Named Insured” under the Policy.\nThe Policy further notes:\nThroughout this policy the words ’you’ and ’your’ refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations, and any other person or organization qualifying as a Named Insured under this policy. The words ’we,’ ’us’ and ’our’ refer to the company providing this insurance.\n(Id. at p. 12.)\nIn addition, the Policy provides that “[t]he word ‘insured’ means any person or organization qualifying as such under Section II — Who Is An Insured.” (Id.) Section II of the Policy, in turn, sets forth individuals and entities that are also covered as “insureds” under the Policy. (See id. at p. 21,1 § II.) For example, “executive officers” and “directors” of the Plaintiff are also “insureds” under the Policy “with, respect to their duties ... as officers or directors.” (Id. at p. 21, § II(l)(d).) In addition, the Plaintiffs “employees” and “volunteer workers” are “insureds” under the Policy for “acts within the scope of their employment” subject to certain exceptions not relevant here. (Id. at p. 21, § 11(2).)\n3. The Coverage for Bodily Injury Liability\nThe Policy states that the Defendant will “pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of ‘bodily injury5 ... to which this insurance applies.” (Id. at p. 12, § l(l)(a)). In addition, the Defendant has the “duty to, defend the insured against any ‘suit5 seeking those damages,” (Id.)\n. “Bodily injury” is defined as “bodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person[.]” (Id. at p, 25, § V(3).) “Suit” is defined as “a civil proceeding in which damages because of ‘bodily injury,5 ‘property damage5 or ‘personal and advertising injury5 to which this, insurance applies are alleged.” (Id. at p. 28, § V(18)).\nThe Policy states that the insurance applies to “bodily injury” if the bodily injury is: (1) “caused by an ’occurrence5 that takes place in the coverage territory”; (2) “occurs during the policy period”; and (3) certain employees of the Plaintiff did not know “prior to the policy period[] that the ’bodily injury5 ... occurred.” (Id. at p. 12, § 1(b).)\nThe Policy also sets a limit of $1,000,000 for each “occurrence” and a $2,000,000 limit in the aggregate for “occurrences” related to “bodily injury” “regardless ■ of the number of: (a) insureds; (b) claims made or ’suits’ brought; [and] (c) persons or organizations making claims or bringing ’suits.’ ” (Id. át p. 2, p. 22, § III(l).)\nAn Endorsement to the Policy also adds, “Any amount otherwise payable under this Policy ... shall be further reduced by any amounts paid or incurred by the [Defendant] in defense of any claim against Named Insured and/or Insured, including amounts paid and incurred, by attorney’s fees, court costs and. litigation expenses.” (Id. at 41.)\n4. The Coverage for Contractual Indemnity Claims\nThe “Supplementary Payments” provision of the Policy states that the Defendant is also obligated .to provide coverage to a third party or indemnitee,; who the Plaintiff has agreed to assume tort liability for as part of an “agreement pertaining to its business,” see id. at p. 20, p. 26, § V(9).\nHowever, Endorsement 1 states that the “Supplementary Payments” provision . is “hereby deleted from the ISO Commercial General.Liability.” (Id. at p, 53.)\nEndorsement 23 appears to replace the “Supplementary Payments” provision with respect to “contractual indemnity” claims. It provides:\nNotwithstanding the limit of coverage showing the Declarations and/or Section III of this policy ,, $10,000 only is the most we will pay as damages for any and all claims, including any claim for contractual indemnification, arising from or related to any ‘bodily injury’; ‘property damage’ or ‘personal injury’ sustained by an employee of an insured while injured, harmed or' damaged in the scope of such employment.\nIn any action brought:by such employee, if you are impleaded into said action, or if any third party action over .[sic] is commenced against you, irrespective of the claims or theories set forth therein, the $10,000 limit of coverage as provided in this, endorsement shall apply when:\n1. The injury sustained by the employee is a ’grave’ injury’ [sic] as defined by Section 11 of the New York State Workers’ Compensation law ...; and\n2. You are required by contract, regulation or law to be insured under a workers’ compensation policy providing liability coverage for claims arising from injuries to employees.\n(Id. at p. 74) (emphasis in original).\nIn addition, a footnote to Endorsement 23 defines “We” and “our” as the “company providing insurance,” and “You” and “Your” as the “Named Insured showing in the Declarations, and any other person or organization qualifying as a Named Insured under this policy.” (Id., n. 4, 5.)\nB. The Underlying Action\nOn October 28, 2008, the Plaintiff entered into a subcontract (the “Subcontract”) with non-party Getronics USA Inc. (“Getronics”) pursuant to which Getronics hired the Plaintiff to perform electronic services at the Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market located at Exterior Street and River Avenue in Bronx, New York (“Gateway Center”). (See Martin Aff., Dkt. No. 46, Exs. A, E.)\nOn March 19, 2009, Anthony Balzano (“Balzano”), an employee of the Plaintiff, was injured while “dressing electrical cable at the Gateway Center” after he allegedly fell from a “hi low lift.” (Martin Aff., Dkt. No. 46, Ex. B, at 3.) As a result of the fall, he allegedly suffered “injuries to his right shoulder, face, right arm and right leg.” (Compl., Ex. D.)\nOn August 7, 2009, Balzano filed a verified complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of State of New York, Bronx County (the “Balzano Action”) against (i) BTM Development Partners, LLC (“BTM”), which owned the Gateway Center; (ii) Target Corporation (“Target”), which leased the premises where Balzano was working when he was injured; and (iii) Plaza Construction Corp. (“Plaza”), which was the general contractor managing construction at the site (collectively, the “Original Bal-zano Defendants”). (Martin Aff., Dkt. No. 46, Ex. E, at ¶¶ 9-16.) The verified complaint asserted claims against the Original Balzano Defendants for negligence and violation of New York Labor Law § 240 for failing to provide proper safety equipment to construction workers working on the site. (See id. at ¶¶ 26-35.)\nOn February 15, 2010, Target filed a third-party complaint against the Plaintiff alleging breach of contract and seeking indemnification and contribution from the Plaintiff for the Balzano Action. (See Compl., Ex. C.)\nSubsequently, the Plaintiff sent timely notice of the third-party complaint to the Defendant and requested coverage under the Policy. On March 12, 2010, the Defendant sent a letter to the Plaintiff disclaiming coverage because Balzano was an employee of the Plaintiff at the time of his accident. Therefore, the Defendant contended that the “Employer’s Liability” exclusion applied and barred coverage to the Plaintiff in defending the Balzano Action. (See Compl., Ex. D.)\nOn August 23, 2010, the Plaintiff filed an action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Suffolk County against the Defendant seeking a declaratory judgment under the Policy that it was entitled to coverage for the Balzano Action (the “Suffolk Declaratory Action”). (See Compl., Ex. E.)\nOn an unspecified date, the Plaintiff moved for summary judgment in the Bal-zano Action to dismiss Target’s third-party claim against it. (See Compl., Ex. F.) On March 7, 2011, the court in the Balzano Action granted summary judgment dismissing the claims by Target against the Plaintiff. (See Compl. at ¶ 14.) Although not stated explicitly in the parties’ papers, it appears that the Plaintiff-and the Defendant stipulated to dismiss the Suffolk Declaratory Action because all of the claims against the Plaintiff in the Balzano Action had been dismissed.\nOn March 17, 2011, Plaza filed a third-party complaint against Getronies for negligence and breach of . contract. (See Compl., Ex. G, at ¶ 6.) At the time of the March 19, • 2009 accident, Getronies was insured under a Commercial General Liability insurance policy issued by-Travelers. (Martin Aff., Dkt. No. 11, at ¶ 7.) Pursuant to that policy, since March 17, 2011, Travelers has been providing counsel to Ge-tronics in the Balzano Action and paying Getronies’ legal fees. (Id.)\nOn July 12, 2011, Getronies filed a third-party complaint against the Plaintiff, asserting claims for negligence and breach of contract, as well as seeking indemnification from the Plaintiff for any liability, damages, and fees incurred in the Balzano Action. (See Compl., Ex. G, Dkt. No. 1-7, at ¶¶ 15,16-18.)\nOn an unspecified date, the Plaintiff notified the Defendant of the third-party complaint filed against it by Getronies and again sought coverage under the Policy for its defense. On January 6, 2012, the Defendant sent a letter to the Plaintiff indicating that Endorsement 23 limited coverage to the Plaintiff in the amount of $10,000. (See Compl., Ex. J.)\nOn June 28, 2012, the Defendant sent a letter to the Plaintiff denying its request for reconsideration and re-affirming its determination that Endorsement 23' limits the amount that the Defendant' is required to indemnify the Plaintiff for “damages” and “legal expenses” in the Balzano Action to $10,000. (See Compl., Ex. K.) However, the Plaintiff indicated in the letter that it intended to cover the Plaintiff’s defense costs but not. Getronies’ defense costs in the Balzano Action subject to its reservation of rights. (See id.)\nThereafter, the parties in the Balzano Action made motions and cross-motions for summary judgment.\nOn September 14, 2014, New York Supreme Court Justice Kenneth L. Thompson, Jr. rendered a decision granting Ge-tronics’ motion for - summary judgment (i) dismissing Plaza’s third party claims against it; and (ii) awarding judgment to Getronies on its third-party indemnification claim against the Plaintiff. (See Martin Aff., Dkt. No:. 46, Ex. B, 8-9.)\nOn November 24, 2014, Travelers, which, as noted, had been providing a defense to Getronies, sent a letter to the Plaintiff and the Defendant demanding that (i) the Plaintiff take over Getronies’ defense in the Balzano Action and (ii) reimburse all reasonable, defense costs incurred to date by Travelers in defending Getronies in the Balzano Action. (See Martin Aff., Dkt. No.'11, Ex. E.)\nIn a December 1, 2014 letter to Travelers, the Plaintiff directed Travelers to seek indemnification from the Defendant, which it contended was obligated to pay Getron-ics’ legal fees under the Policy. (See Martin Aff., Dkt. No. 11, Ex. F.)\nAccording to Travelers, the Defendant never responded to its November 24, 2014 letter.\nC. The Instant Action\nAs noted on September' 6, 2014, the Plaintiff initiated this action against the Defendant seeking a declaratory judgment that the Policy “obligates [the Defendant] to defend and indemnify [the] [P]laintiff in the underlying action brought by Anthony Balzano and third-party action brought by Getronies [ ] to the extent of the one million dollar ... policy limit” and “[a]n award of costs and expenses of this action together with reasonable attorneys’ fees and expert fees[.]” (Compl. at ¶ 24.)\nOn September 24,. 2015, the Court rendered a decision granting Travelers’ motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2) to intervene in this action.\nOn October 7, 2015, Travelers filed an Intervenor complaint seeking a declaratory judgment stating that (i) “Getronics’ judgment of contractual indemnity owed to it by [the Plaintiff] is a covered loss under the [Defendant’s] Policy”; (ii) the Defendant is “required to pay 100% of the past defense and future indemnity costs associated with the claims brought in the Balza-no Lawsuit against Getronics”; and (iii) the Defendant is “liable to Travelers for any and'all damages Travelers incurs by virtue of [the Defendant’s] breach of its insurance, contractual and common law obligations.” (The Intervenor’s Compl. at ¶ 41.)\nPresently before the Court is (i) the Defendant’s motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Fed. R. 'Civ. P. 12(b)(6), 12(d), and 56; and (ii) the Plaintiffs cross motion for summary judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.\nII. DISCUSSION\nA. Legal Standards\n1. The Defendant’s Motion\nThe Defendant styles its present motion as a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. 12(b)(6) and in the alternative, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d) and 56.\n“In adjudicating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a district court must confine its consideration ‘to facts stated on the face of the complaint, in documents appended to the complaint or incorporated in the complaint by reference, and to matters of which judicial notice may be taken.’” Leonard F. v. Israel Disc. Bank of New York, 199 F.3d 99, 107 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting Allen v. WestPoint-Pepperell, Inc., 945 F.2d 40, 44 (2d Cir.1991)).\nHowever, Rule 12(d) gives the court discretion to convert a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss to a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment when the parties present matters to the Court outside the pleadings, and the parties are “given, the reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.” With respect to this latter notice requirement, the. Second Circuit has stated that “[t]he essential inquiry is whether the appellant should reasonably have recognized the possibility that the motion might be converted into one for summary judgment or was taken by surprise and. deprived of a reasonable opportunity to meet facts outside the pleadings.” In re G. & A. Books, Inc., 770 F.2d 288, 295 (2d Cir.1985).\nIn that:regard, “’[a] party cannot complain of lack of a reasonable opportunity to present all material relevant to a motion for summary judgment when both parties have filed-exhibits, affidavits, counter-affidavits, depositions, etc. in support of and in opposition to a motion to dismiss.’,” Sahu v. Union Carbide Corp., 548 F.3d 59, 67 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting G. & A Books, 770 F.2d at 295) (alteration in original). Indeed, “[e]ven where only the party moving to dismiss has submitted extrinsic material such as depositions or affidavits, the opposing party may be deemed to have had adequate notice that the motion to dismiss would be converted.” Id. (quoting G. & A. Books, 770 F.2d at 295) (alteration added). . ,\nIn addition, where the party ■ opposing the Rule 12(b)(6) motion files a cross-motion for- summary judgment, courts have also held that the movant has adequate notice that his or her Rule 12(b)(6) motion may be converted to a motion for summary judgment. See Green Tree Servicing LLC v. Christodoulakis, No. 14-CV-2037 (SJF) (AYS), 136 F.Supp.3d 415, 433, 2015 WL 5719808, at *15 n. 2 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2015) (“[Sjince— the parties were afforded a reasonable ■ opportunity to present materials outside the pleadings and, in fact, submitted such materials in support of, and in opposition to, plaintiffs cross motion for summary judgment, I need not exclude the extrinsic, evidence from my consideration of defendants’ motion .under Rule 12(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.”); Maecker v. Everhome Mortgage Co., No. 13CV305A (HUS), 2014 WL 6673720, at *3 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2014), report and recommendation adopted, No. 13-CV-305, 2014 WL 1270031 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2014) (“Here, the defendant refers to loan documents, that were not attached to the complaint. The plaintiff has also filed a cross-motion for summary judgment ..... Thus, the Court will treat the instant motion as a motion for summary judgment.”).\nHere, in support of its Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Defendant relied for the most part on documents that were attached to and incorporated in the complaint. However, in opposition to the Defendant’s motion, the Plaintiff filed two affidavits by Christian Peterson (“Peterson”), the President of the Plaintiff, and J. Caesar Galarza (“Galarza”), the Plaintiffs counsel, which refer to facts outside of the complaint. (See Galarza Aff., Dkt. No. 37.) Further, the Plaintiff filed a cross-motion for summary judgment and attached a separate affidavit by Galarza that again referred to matters outside of the complaint. (See Galarza Aff., Dkt. No. 38-2.)\nBased on the fact that the Plaintiff filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, the Defendant clearly had the opportunity to provide ■ facts outside the pleadings. Indeed, the Defendant must have recognized the possibility that the Court would convert its Rule- 12(b)(6) motion into a Rule 56 motion given that it moved in the alternative under Rule 12(d) and Rule 56. See Sahu, 548 F.3d at 69 (“A motion called a motion for summary judgment, whether or not stated as alternatively for dismissal, ordinarily will place a plaintiff on notice that the district court is being asked to look beyond the pleadings to the evidence in order to decide the motion.”) (emphasis added); Sabeniano v. Citibank, N.A. New York, No. 12 CIV. 1928 ALC DCF, 2013 WL 1164891, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 20, 2013) (“In fact, Defendant styled its Motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(d), indicating it anticipated conversion.’’ Therefore, the Court will treat the pending motions as cross-motions for summary judgment.).\nAccordingly, the Court will convert the Defendant’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to one under Rule 56. However, the Court notes that regardless of what standard it. applies to the parties’ motions, their dispute centers on the interpretation of Endorsement 23 of the Policy. As explained below, the Court finds that the plain language of Endorsement 23 affords the coverage sought by the Plaintiff in this action. Therefore, the Court does not need to resort to any extrinsic evidence to resolve the parties’ dispute despite the fact that it finds that it is permitted to do so.\n2. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56\nFed. R. Civ.’ P. 56(a) provides that a court may grant summary judgment when the “movant shows there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”\n“Where the moving party demonstrates 'the absence of a genuine issue of material fact,’ Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986), the opposing party must come forward with specific evidence demonstrating the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact.” Brown v. Eli Lilly & Co., 654 F.3d 347, 358 (2d Cir.2011) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).\nIn that regard, a party “must do more than simply show that there is some meta:physical doubt as to the material facts[.]” Id. (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986)). Further, the opposing party “ ‘may not rely on cónclusory allegations or únsubstantíated speculation!)]’ ” F.D.I.C. v. Great Am. Ins. Co., 607 F.3d 288, 292 (2d Cir.2010) (quoting Scotto v. Almenas, 143 F.3d 105, 114 (2d Cir.1998)).\n“Where it is clear that no rational finder of fact ‘could find in favor of the nonmov-ing party because the evidence to support its cáse is so slight,’ summary judgment should be granted.” Id. (quoting Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs., Ltd. P’ship, 22 F.3d 1219, 1224 (2d Cir.1994)).\nB. As to Jurisdiction and Choice of Law\n1. Jurisdiction\nAs an initial matter, the Court notes that the complaint alleges that this Court has jurisdiction over this action based on “28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1332, 1337 and 1343, and has supplemental jurisdiction over [the] Plaintiffs state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391.” (Compl. at ¶ 1.)\nHowever, most of these jurisdictional statutes do not apply to this case.\n28 U.S.C. § 1331 confers federal jurisdiction over “all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.” Here, the Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a) (the “Declaratory Judgment Act”), that it is afforded coverage under the Policy for damages and attorneys’ fees resulting from the Balzano Action up to the general policy limit of $1,000,000. However, the Declaratory Judgment Act does not confer subject matter jurisdiction, and the parties do not raise any federal issue relating to the interpretation of the Policy. See Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v. Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians, 94 F.3d 747, 752 (2d Cir.1996) (“Section 2201 provides no independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction:”); Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. v. Lloyds TSB Gen. Leasing (No. 20) Ltd., 774 F.Supp.2d 431, 437-38 (D.Conn. 2011) (“ ‘[T]he declaratory judgment statute does not confer jurisdiction on a district court,’ and ‘a complaint-' seeking, a declaratory judgment is to be tested, for purposes of the well-pleaded complaint rule, as if the party whose adverse action the declaratory judgment plaintiff apprehends had initiated a lawsuit against the declaratory judgment plaintiff.’ ”) (quoting Fleet Bank, Nat. Ass’n v. Burke, 160 F.3d 883, 885-86 (2d Cir.1998) (alteration in original)). Therefore, the Plaintiffs claim does not “arise” under federal law, and 28 U.S.C. §■ 1331 is not applicable, to this case.\nSimilarly, 28 U.S.C. § 1337, which confers jurisdiction over actions arising under an Act of Congress regulating commerce, and 28 U.S.C. .§ 1343, which confers jurisdiction over actions in which an individual is deprived of his or her civil rights, are clearly not applicable to the Plaintiffs declaratory judgment claim because it is based solely on. the interpretation of an insurance policy and is governed by state law.\nHowever, the Court does have diversity jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332, which confers federal jurisdiction over matters that involve an amount in controversy that exceeds $75,000 .and is- between citizens of different states. “To determine the amount in controversy in a declaratory action premised on diversity jurisdiction, courts look to the ’potential monetary value of the right, or amount of the liability,’ in ’a present or potential coercive action[.]’” Garanti Finansal Kiralama A.S. v. Aqua Marine & Trading Inc., 697 F.3d 59, 68 (2d Cir.2012) (quoting parenthetically Developments in the Law: Declaratory Judgments—1941-1949, 62 Harv. L. Rev. 787, 801 (1949)); see also Am. Standard, Inc. v. Oakfabco, Inc., 498 F.Supp.2d 711, 717 (S.D.N.Y.2007) (“In actions seeking declaratory or injunctive relief, the amount in controversy is measured by the value of the object of the litigation.”).\nHere, the parties are diverse — the Plaintiff is a New York corporation and the Defendant is a Montana insurance group with its principal place of business in Montana. Further, the potential liability to the Defendant is the $1 million limit on coverage set forth in the Policy. Therefore, there is diversity, jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs declaration judgment claim.\n2. Choice of Law\nAs the basis of jurisdiction is diversity of citizenship, the Court must next determine what law to apply in interpreting the Policy.'In that regard, the Plaintiffs chosen forum is New York. Therefore, this Court must apply New York principles in determining the choice of law. See Booking v. Gen. Star Mgmt. Co., 254 F.3d 414, 419 (2d Cir.2001). Under those principles, “ ‘ [t]he first step ... is to determine whether there is an actual conflict between the laws of the jurisdictions ’ involved.’” Schwartz v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 539 F.3d 135, 151 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting. In re Allstate Ins. Co., 81 N.Y.2d 219, 223, 597 N.Y.S.2d 904, 613 N.E.2d 936 (1993) (alteration in original)).\nHere, the Policy contains a choice of law clause selecting Montana law: “This Policy shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Montana.” (Martin Aff., Dkt. No. 46,' Ex. C, at p. 52, § XII.) However, “even when the parties include a choice-of-law clause in their contract, their conduct during litigation may indicate assent to the application of another state’s law.” Cargill, Inc. v. Charles Kowsky Res., Inc., 949 F.2d 51, 55 (2d Cir.1991) (citing Walter E. Heller & Co. v. Video Innovations, Inc., 730 F.2d 50, 52 (2d Cir.1984)).\nFor example, where the parties fail to bring a foreign choice of law clause to the Court’s attention and apply New York law in their briefs, courts have found that the parties consented to the application of New York law and will disregard the foreign choice of law clause. See Walter E. Heller & Co., 730 F.2d at 52 (“Although New York courts generally accord deference to choice-of-law provisions in contracts, ... such provisions are not controlling and may be disregarded where the most significant contacts with the matter in dispute are in another State .... Moreover, in the absence of a strong countervailing public policy, the parties to litigation' may consent by their conduct to the law to be applied.”) (emphasis added).\nHere, the parties do not bring the choice of law clause to the Court’s attention and rely primarily on New York cases in their - legal memoranda. Thus, the parties’ conduct indicates consent to the application of New York law. Further, New York has the strongest relationship to the Plaintiffs claim because the Plaintiff is a New York corporation, the underlying third-party contractual indemnity claim is pending in New York state court, and the Balzano Action arises from a personal injury that took place in New York.'Therefore, the Court will disregard the Montana choice of law provision and will instead apply New York law to interpreting, the Policy. See Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. Flow Int’l Corp., 844 F.Supp.2d 286, 300 (N.D.N.Y.2012) (“‘[E]ven where the parties include a choice of law clause in their contract, their conduct, during litigation may indicate assent to the application of another state’s law,’ and the court may therefore disregard the clause and apply the law to which the parties have assented.”) (quoting Bombardier Capital, Inc. v. Richfield Housing Center, Inc., Nos. 91-CV-750, 91-CV-502, 1994 WL 118294, at *3 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 21, 1994)).\n3. The Applicable New York Law\n“Under New York law, insurance policies are interpreted according to general rules of contract interpretation.” Olin Corp. v. Am. Home Assur. Co., 704 F.3d 89, 98 (2d Cir.2012). Those rules of interpretation require the court “ ’to give effect to the intent of the parties as expressed in the clear language of the contract.’” Ment Bros. Iron Works Co. v. Interstate Fire & Cas. Co., 702 F.3d 118, 122 (2d Cir.2012) (quoting Mount Vernon Fire Ins. Co. v. Belize NY, Inc., 277 F.3d 232, 236 (2d Cir.2002)). Further, the “[t]erms in an insurance contract must be given “’their plain and ordinary meaning.’”” Id. (quoting 10 Ellicott Square Court Corp. v. Mountain Valley Indem. Co., 634 F.3d 112, 119 (2d Cir.2010)).\nAs an initial matter, when deciding a motion for summary judgment, a court must determine whether the disputed language of the policy is ambiguous. See Law Debenture Trust Co. of New York v. Maverick Tube Corp., 595 F.3d 458, 465 (2d Cir.2010) (“Under New York law, which the parties agree is controlling here, the initial question for the court on a motion for summary judgment with respect to a contract claim is ^whether the contract is unambiguous with respect to the question disputed by the parties.’ ”) (quoting International Multifoods Corp. v. Commercial Union Insurance Co., 309 F.3d 76, 83 (2d Cir.2002)).\nContract language is ambiguous when it is “‘capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs, practices, usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.’ ” JA Apparel Corp. v. Abboud, 568 F.3d 390, 396-97 (2d Cir.2009) (quoting Revson v. Cinque & Cinque, P.C., 221 F.3d 59, 66 (2d Cir.2000)).\n“When the question is a contract’s proper construction, summary judgment may be granted when its words convey a definite and precise meaning absent any ambiguity.” Seiden Associates, Inc. v. ANC Holdings, Inc., 959 F.2d 425, 428 (2d Cir. 1992).\nOn the other hand, “[i]f a court concludes a provision in an insurance contract is ambiguous, it may consider extrinsic evidence to ascertain the parties’ intent at the formation of the contract.” Olin Corp., 704 F.3d at 99 (JA Apparel Corp., 568 F.3d at 397). “If the extrinsic evidence fails' to establish the .parties’ intent, courts may apply other rules of contract interpretation, including New York’s rule of contra proferentem, according to which ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the insured.” Id.\nC. As to the Parties’ Cross-Motions\nHere, the Policy provides a $1,000,000 limit per occurrence for claims arising from “bodily injury.” The Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that it is entitled to indemnification up to the $1,000,000 Policy limit for damages and expenses incurred in defending against the third-party 1 contractual indemnification claim brought by Getronics against it in the Balzano Action.\nThe Defendant does not dispute that the claim asserted by Getronics against the Plaintiff in the Balzano Action arises out of a “bodily injury” to Balzano, and is there-; fore, covered under the Policy. However, the Defendant asserts that the language of Endorsement 28 “limits the amount of coverage for [the Plaintiff] in the Underlying Action to $10,000.” (The Def.’s Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. 5-9, at 7.)\nEndorsement 23 provides:\nNotwithstanding the limit of coverage shown in the Declaration and/or Section II of this policy ..., $10,000 only is the most we will pay as damages for any and all claims, including any claim for contractual indemnification, arising from or relating to any ‘bodily injury5 ... sustained by -an employee of an insured while injured, harmed or damages in the scope of such employment.\nIn any action brought by such employee, if you are impleaded into said action, or if any third party action over [sic] is commenced against you, irrespective of the claims or theories set forth therein, the $10,000 limit of coverage as provided in this endorsement shall apply when:\n1. The injury sustained by the employee is a ‘grave injury’ as defined by Section 11 of the New York State Workers’ Compensation Law, as fol- . lows:\n• Death\n• Permanent and total loss or use or amputation of an arm, leg, hand or foot,\n• Loss of múltiple fingers, '\n• Loss of multiple toes,\n• Paraplegia or quadriplegia,\n• Total and permanent blindness,\n• Total and permanent deafness,\n• Loss of nose,\n• Loss of ear,\n• Permanent and severe facial disfigurement,\n• Loss of an index finger; or\n■ • An acquired injury to the brain caused by an external physical force . resulting in total permanent disability; and\n2. You are required by contract, regulation or law to be insured under a workers’ compensation policy providing liability -coverage for claims arising from injuries to employees.\n(Martin Aff., Ex. C, at p; 74-5) (emphasis in original). In addition, the Endorsement defines the words “we” - and “our” as “the company providing this insurance” and the words “you” and “your” as the “Named Insured shown in the declarations, and any other person or organization qualifying as a Named Insured under this [P]olicy.” (Id at p. 74.)\nThe Defendant' relies primarily on the first paragraph of Endorsement 23, which limits the amount that the Defendant will pay in damages to $10,000 for “any and all. claims, including any claim for contractual indemnification, arising from or,relating to any ‘bodily injury’ sustained by an employee of an insured.” (The Def.’s Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. 5-9, at 6-7.)\nIt is undisputed that Balzano was an employee of the Plaintiff; sustained bodily injuries in the course of his employment; and initiated the Balzano- Action seeking damages resulting from his injuries. It is also undisputed that Getronics, who hired the Plaintiff as a sub-contractor on the project, impleaded the Plaintiff into the Balzano Action seeking contractual indemnity. Thus, there is also no dispute that Getronics’ contractual indemnity claim against the Plaintiff “arises from or relates” to Balzano’s injury. Therefore, the Defendant asserts that the first paragraph of “Endorsement 23 clearly and unambiguously limits any obligation under the [Defendant’s] Policy to $10,000” for damages resulting from Getronics’ third-party claim. (The Def.’s Mem. of Law at 6-7.)\nOn the other hand, the Plaintiff asserts that the second paragraph, not the first paragraph, governs the present dispute. Under the second paragraph, “if you are impleaded into said action, or if any third party action over [sic] is commenced against you .... the $10,000 limit of coverage as provided in this endorsement shall apply when -.... [t]he injury sustained by the employee is a ‘grave injury’ as defined by Section 11 of the New York State Workers’ Compensation Law.”\nIt is undisputed that the Plaintiff was impleaded into the Balzano Action when Getronics filed a' third-party complaint in the Balzano Action against the Plaintiff seeking, among other things, contractual indemnity under the Subcontract. (See Compl., Ex. G.)\nFurther, the Plaintiff claims that it is also undisputed that Balzano did not suffer a “grave injury” as defined by the New York State Workers’ Compensation Law. (See the PL’s Repy Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. 41, at ¶ 9; the Intervenor PL’s Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. 45, at p. 9-10.)\nThe Defendant does not appear to dispute this statement in its memorandum of law, nor does it file a Local Civil Rule 56.1 statement. Also, there is no evidence in the record suggesting that Balzano suffered a “grave injury” under New York State Workers’ Compensation Law. (See Martin Aff., Ex. C, at p. 74-5.) Indeed, according to the Defendant’s own account of Balza-no’s injury set forth in its March 12, 2010 coverage letter to the Plaintiff, Balzano “sustained injuries to his right shoulder, face, right arm.and right leg” as a result of falling from a lift on the job site. (See Compl., Ex. D.) Nowhere in this letter, nor in Balzano’s underlying state complaint, is it alleged that Balzano’s leg, shoulder, or arm had to be amputated as a result of his injuries, or that he suffered “permanent and severe facial disfigurement.” Accordingly, the Court agrees with the Plaintiff that it is undisputed for purposes of this motion that Balzano did not suffer a “grave injury” under New York State Workers’ Compensation Law.\nThus, the Plaintiff asserts that under the plain language of the second paragraph of Endorsement 23, the coverage afforded to him is not limited to $10,000 but is rather subject to the general policy limit of $1,000,000 for all claims relating to “bodily injury.” (See the PL’s Mem. of Law at 3.) .\nIn addition, the Intervenor Plaintiff filed a legal memorandum concurring with the Plaintiffs interpretation of Endorsement 23 and asserting that the Court should reject the Defendant’s reading of the Endorsement. (The Intervenor PL’s Mem. of Law at 2-3.)\nThe Court finds that the plain language of Endorsement 23 and the canons of contract iiiterpretation support the interpretation offered by the Plaintiff, and therefore, the ;Court need not reach the- parole evidence offered by the Plaintiff.\nThe first paragraph of Endorsement 23 states, “$10,000 only is the most we will pay as damages for any and all claims, including any claim for contractual indemnification, arising from or belated to any ‘bodily injury5 ... sustained by an employee of an insured while injured, harmed, or damages in the scope of such employment.” (Martin Aff., Ex. C, at p. 74-5) (emphasis added).\nThe second paragraph of Endorsement 23 states, “In any action brought by such, employee if You are impleaded into said action or if any third party action ... is commenced against You, irrespective of the claims or theories set forth therein, the $10,000 limit of coverage as provided shall apply when ... the injury sustained by-the employee is a ‘grave injury” as defined by Section -11 of the New York -State Workers’ Compensation Law.” (Id.) (emphasis added). As noted, a footnote to the Endorsement states that, “[t]he words ‘you’ and ‘your’ refer to the Named Insured shown in the declaration, any other person or organization qualifying as a Named Insured under this policy.” (Id.) (emphasis added).\nThus, the plain language of the first paragraph refers only to claims “arising from ... any ‘bodily injury1 .,. sustained by an employee of an insured”; while the second paragraph refers to actions where “You” — meaning the Named Insured — is impleaded into the action or third party actions commenced against ‘You” — meaning the Named Insured.”\nThat distinction is critical because the Policy defines the “Named Insured”- and “an insured” differently. The “Named Insured” is defined as “the Member identified on- the Declaration of the Policy.” (Martin Aff., Ex. C, at p. 9.) The Plaintiff is the only “Member” identified in the Policy Declarations, and therefore, is the sole “Named Insured,” under, the Policy. (Id. at p. 2.)\nOn the other hand, an “insured”.is defined by Section II of the Policy as referring to individuals associated with the Plaintiff, such' as the Plaintiff’s “executive officers,” “directors,” “shareholders,” “volunteer workers,” and “employees.” (Martin Aff., Ex. C, at p. 21, § II(l)(d).)\nThis distinction is made clear in the first paragraph of the Policy which states, “Throughout this policy the words ‘you’ and ‘your’ refer to the Named Insured showing the Policy Declarations. ..... The word ‘insured’ means any person or organization qualifying as such under Section II — Who Is An Insured.” (Id. at p. 12.) As the Intervenor. Plaintiff correctly notes, the distinction between the “Named Insured” and an “Insured” is also carried through in other sections of the Policy. For example, an Endorsement to the Policy setting forth the “Aggregate Limit” on coverage repeatedly refers to the “Named Insured” and an “Insured” separately: “In other words, if the [Defendant] pays a elaim(s) which coverage is provided to a Named Insured and/or Insured in an amount equal to the Aggregate limit ... the [Defendant] shall not have any further liability under the Policy”; “Any amount otherwise payable under this Policy including the Per Occurrence Limit or Aggregate Limit shall be further reduced by any amount paid or incurred by the [Defendant] in defense of any claim against any Named Insured and/or Insured”; and “Any Named Insured and/or Insured making a claim must give the [Defendant] notice in writing of any claim within sixth (60) days ... after it is unknown to any Named Insured and/or Insured during the Term.” (Id. at p. 41-42) (emphasis added).\nTherefore, it is clear from the Policy language that the “Named Insured” and the “Insured”- refer to different entities. Applying these definitions, the first paragraph of Endorsement 23, which limits coverage -to ■ $10,000 in damages “for any and all claims, including any claim for contractual .indemnification, arising from or. relating to any ’bodily injury’ ... sustained by an employee of an insured,” applies to claims against the Plaintiffs executive officers,' directors, shareholders, employees, and volunteer workers. On the other hand, the second paragraph applies to actions- where “You” — meaning the “Named Insured,” which refers1 solély to the Plaintiff — is impleaded into the action or a third party action is commenced against “You” — again referring to the “Named Insured,” meaning the Plaintiff-— and the injury sustained by the Plaintiffs employee is a “grave injury.”\nThe Court finds that this reading of Endorsement 23, which is favored by the Plaintiff, gives effect to both the first and second paragraphs of the Endorsement and is consistent with the Policy as a whole. Promuto v. Waste Mgmt., Inc., 44 F.Supp.2d 628, 650 (S.D.N.Y.1999) (“The Court must read the indemnification provision in ’ conjunction with all other provisions in the agreement to avoid inconsistencies or an interpretation which would render another provision superfluous or without effect.”).\nOn the other hand, the Defendant asks the Court to read the first paragraph of Endorsement 23 as applying a limit of $10,000 for coverage over any claims arising out of a “bodily injury” to an employee regardless of whether those claims were brought against an “insured” or the “Named Insured.” Such a reading ignores the distinction established by the Policy between “an insured” and the-“Named Insured.” It also renders the second paragraph meaningless because if, as the Defendant contends, the first paragraph-was intended to limit coverage under the Policy to “any claims” brought by employees against an “insured” and the1 “Named Insured,” then there would be no need to include the second paragraph of the En-, dorsement specifying that the $10,000 limit on ■ damages applies to claims - brought against the Named Insured that involve a “grave injury.”\nTherefore, -the Court declines' to adopt the Defendant’s interpretation because it ignores the plain language of the Policy, is inconsistent with the Policy as a whole, and renders., the second paragraph of the Policy superfluous. See LaSalle Bank Nat. Ass’n v. Nomura Asset Capital Corp., 424 F.3d 195, 206 (2d Cir.2005) (“‘[A]n interpretation of a contract that has ‘the effect of rendering at least one clause superfluous or 'meaningless ... is not preferred and will be ayoided if possible.’ ”); Travelers Indem. Co. of Ill. v. F & S London Pub, Inc., 270 F.Supp.2d 330, 334 (E.D.N.Y.2003) (rejecting an interpretation of an insurance policy because “Paragraph 4 of the Lease would be rendered meaningless if the indemnity clauses were read to encompass any and all damage to the Property, regardless of fault.”)\nApplying the Plaintiff’s reading of Endorsement 23 to the facts of this case, it is clear that the Endorsement does not limit coverage to the Plaintiff for the Balzano Action. That is because, as noted above, it is undisputed that -Getronies impleaded the Plaintiff, -which is -the “Named Insured,” into the Balzano Action, and Balzano does not allege that he suffered a “grave injury” under New York State Workers’ Compensation Law. Thus, under the plain- language . of the second paragraph of Endorsement 23 the coverage afforded to the Plaintiff in the Balzano Action is, not limited to $10,000. Instead, the Plaintiff is entitled to coverage up to the $1,000,000 general policy-limit for actions arising from “bodily injury.”\nTherefore, the Court finds that the Plaintiff >is entitled to -a judgment, stating that the Defendant is- required to “defend and indemnify [the] [P]laintiff in the underlying action brought by Anthony Balza-no and [the] third-party action brought by Getronies USA .to the extent- of the one million dollar. ($1,000,000) policy limit.” (See Compl. at ¶ 24.) Accordingly, the Court grants the Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and denies the Defendant’s motion to dismiss.\nThe Court notes that the Intervenors have also filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment stating that (i) “Ge-tronies’ judgment of contractual indemnity owed to it by the Plaintiff is a ‘covered loss’ under the Defendant’s Policy”; (ii) the Defendant is ‘Required to. pay 100% of the past defense and future indemnity costs associated with the claims brought in the Balzano Lawsuit against Getronics”; and (iii) the Défendant is “liable to [the Inter-venor Plaintiff] for any and all damages Travelers incurs by virtue of the [Defendant’s] breach of its insurance, contractual and common law obligations.” (The In-ververior Compl. at ¶ 41.)\nThis claim is not the subject of the Plaintiffs present motion for summary judgment and seeks a judgment that has different wording and appears somewhat broader than the declaratory judgment sought by the Plaintiff, However, the Court recognizes that this decision may render the Intervenor Plaintiff’s claim for a declaratory judgment unnecessary because the Court has ruled that the Plaintiff is entitled to, coverage under the Policy for the Balzano Action up to the $1,000,000 general policy limit. Therefore, the Court directs the Intervenor Plaintiff to file a letter on ECF no longer than three pages within five days of the date of this decision regarding the status of its claim in light of. this decision.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Defendant’s motion to dismiss is denied, the Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment is granted, and the Plaintiff is entitled to a declaratory judgment stating that the Defendant is required to “defend and indemnify the Plaintiff in the underlying action brought by Anthony Balzano and the third-party action brought by Getronics USA to the extent of the one million dollar ($1,000,000) policy limit.”\nFurther, the Court directs the Interve-nor Plaintiff to file a letter on ECF within five days of the-date of this decision informing the Court of the status of its claim for a declaratory judgment in light of this decision. -\nSO ORDERED."", 'type': 'majority'}]"

McMickie, Alpharetta, GA, for Defendant-Appellant.""],""opinions"":[{""author"":""LOKEN, Circuit Judge."",""text"":""LOKEN, Circuit Judge.\nThis is a liability insurance coverage dispute. In April 2011, independent owner-operator Steven Heinis leased his Volvo semi-tractor and Trailmobile tanker-trailer to Avery Enterprises (“Avery”), a trucking firm providing services to the oil and gas industry in the Bakken oilfields in North Dakota. On June 18, Heinis drove the tractor-trailer rig to Avery’s shop in Powers Lake, North Dakota, to repair a crack in the loading valve or pipe on Heinis’s trailer. When Jesse Miller, a shop employee, contacted the pipe with his welding torch, an explosion occurred, injuring Miller, who received workers’ compensation benefits from the North Dakota Workforce Safety & Insurance Organization and filed a state court negligence action against Heinis. See N.D. Cent.Code Ch. 65-02, § 65-01-09.\nAt the time in question, Great West Casualty Company (“Great West”) was Heinis’s commercial lines liability insurer, and National Casualty Company (“National”) was Avery’s commercial motor carrier liability insurer. Great West filed this declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that National is contractually obligated to defend and indemnify Heinis in Miller’s pending state court lawsuit and Great West is not. National’s Amended Answer asserted contrary positions. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Great West, concluding that Miller’s negligence claim against Heinis was covered under National’s policy and excluded under Great West’s policy. Great W. Cas. Co. v. Nat’l Cas. Co., 53 F.Supp.3d 1154, 1190 (D.N.D.2014). National appeals. Though the parties have argued other issues, to resolve the appeal we need only determine (i) that Heinis was an “insured” under the National policy, (ii) that neither of two exclusions in the National policy applied, and (iii) that the exclusion in Great West’s policy applied. Reviewing these issues de novo, we affirm.\nI. Background\nThe April 2011 Lease Agreement provided that Avery would dispatch Heinis to haul fresh water to drilling sites and contaminated “flowback” water from drilling sites to disposal facilities. Avery dispatched and paid Heinis on a per-job basis. The lease required Heinis to remain in “constant contact” with Avery and to respond to dispatches within a reasonable amount of time. Heinis hauled only for Avery from the commencement of the lease until the June 2011 accident. Heinis agreed to maintain the tractor and trailer in good and safe operational condition, to comply with federal motor carrier safety regulations, and to be responsible for the cost of repairs, maintenance, and fuel. The lease required Avery to maintain “fleet cargo and liability insurance” for the equipment, and required Heinis to maintain “property and casualty insurance (bobtail) for the leased equipment.” At the time of the accident, Avery’s name and DOT motor carrier numbers were affixed to the tractor.\nSome days prior to the accident, Heinis noticed a leak from the trailer’s valve or pipe during loading and unloading. After using a bucket to prevent spills while loading and unloading at least one load of contaminated water, Heinis called Kevin Avery the day before the accident and arranged to have the leak repaired at Avery’s repair shop. It is undisputed that the repair was Heinis’s responsibility under the Lease Agreement and that Heinis was not required to have the repair done at Avery’s shop. The next day, Heinis testified, he backed the trailer into the shop, unhooked the trailer before Miller undertook the repair, and rehooked the trailer after the explosion to pull it away from the scene. Kevin Avery testified that the tractor and trailer were hooked together when he ran out of his office after hearing the explosion.\nMiller sued Heinis to recover damages for the serious injuries Miller sustained while undertaking, at Avery’s shop, repairs that were Heinis’s responsibility under the lease. Whether Miller’s claims are covered under Avery’s policy with National and/or under Heinis’s policy with Great West requires us to review de novo the district court’s interpretation of these insurance contracts, as well as its decision to grant summary judgment. See Land O’ Lakes, Inc. v. Empl’rs Ins. Co. of Wausau, 728 F.3d 822, 827 (8th Cir.2013).\nII. Whether National’s Policy Provided Coverage to Heinis\nNational’s policy provided coverage to an insured for “ ‘bodily injur/ or ‘property damage’ to which this insurance applies, caused by an ‘accident’ and resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of a covered ‘auto.’ ” National argues there was no coverage because the “Who Is An Insured” provision did not include Heinis, and because two exclusions applied. The parties do not challenge the district court’s determination that North Dakota law governs these issues. Great W., 53 F.Supp.3d at 1159. Under North Dakota law:\nThe interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law, fully reviewable on appeal. Our goal when interpreting insurance policies, as when construing other contracts, is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting. NDCC § 9-07-03.

Norgard, 518 N.W.2d 179, 181 (N.D.1994) (other citations omitted).\nA. Was Heinis a Covered Insured? Section II.A.1.C. of National’s Motor Carrier Coverage Form provided that Who Is An Insured included:\nc. The owner or anyone else from whom you [Avery] hire or borrow a covered “auto” that is a “trailer” while the “trailer” is connected to another covered “auto” that is a power unit, or, if not connected, is being used exclusively in your business.\nIt is undisputed that Heinis’s leased tractor was a covered auto “power unit” and that Miller’s injuries resulted from an accident during “maintenance or use” of the leased trailer. Great West argued that Heinis was an insured because the trailer was a covered auto under § II.A.1.C. National argued that § II.A.1.C. did not apply because the accident occurred when the tractor and trailer were not “connected” and the trailer was not being used exclusively in Avery’s business. The district court concluded that § II.A.1.C. applied because the trailer was being used exclusively in Avery’s business at the time of the accident. Great W., 53 F.Supp.3d at 1162-71. We need not reach that question because we conclude that, even if the trailer was not being used exclusively in Aver/s business at the time of the accident, it was “connected to another covered ‘auto’ that is a power unit.”\nNational argues that § II.A.1.C. did not provide coverage because “connected” required that the trailer be physically attached to a covered power unit when the accident occurred, and Heinis testified that he unhooked the tractor and trailer before Miller began the repairs. We agree with the district court that whether the tractor and trailer were physically attached when the explosion occurred was at least a disputed issue of fact. At the summary judgment stage, we must view the facts in favor of the non-moving party, and therefore we assume the trailer was physically unhooked at the moment the explosion occurred. See, e.g., Watkins Inc. v. Chilkoot Distrib., Inc., 655 F.3d 802, 803 (8th Cir.2011). Büt we conclude this is not a material fact dispute that precludes the grant of summary judgment. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).\nWe are unaware of any case, from North Dakota or any jurisdiction, that has interpreted the word “connected” in this context. Thus, we must determine how the Supreme Court of North Dakota would resolve the issue. See, e.g., Hudson Specialty Ins. Co. v. Brash Tygr, LLC, 769 F.3d 586, 591 (8th Cir.2014). That Court would “look first to the language of the insurance contract, and if the policy language is clear on its face, there is no room for construction. If coverage hinges on an undefined term, we apply the plain, ordinary meaning of the term in interpreting the contract.” Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Decker, 704 N.W.2d 857, 860 (N.D.2005). In conducting this analysis, “a contract may be explained by reference to the circumstances under which it was made and the matter to which it relates.” Norgard, 518 N.W.2d at 183, citing N.D. Cent. Code § 9-07-12.\nBecause National’s policy does not define the term “connected,” we must give the term its plain, ordinary meaning. Webster’s Third New International Dictionary defines “connected” as including objects “joined or linked together,” or “having the parts or elements logically related,” at 480 (1986). This definition includes objects that are physically attached, but the words “linked” and “logically related” do not require physical attachment. So the term as used in § II.A.1.C. needs to be defined by reference to “the matter to which it relates.”\nA commercial tractor and trailer need not operate as a single unit. The trailer can be unhitched and hauled by other tractors operating for different owners or lessees under different contracts. When the tractor is a “covered auto,” this provision was obviously intended to exclude coverage for accidents arising from use of a companion trailer when the trailer is operated separately from the tractor and the insured’s business. But when a scheduled trailer is “connected,” that is, functioning as a unit with a scheduled tractor, both are covered autos. There clearly are times when a trailer is briefly unhooked from a tractor for a reason that is consistent with the trailer’s status as a covered auto. For example, the driver performing a haul for the insured may briefly detach the trailer to save fuel while he drives to a nearby filling station to refuel the tractor. The trailer is physically unhooked, but the tractor and trailer are still an operating unit, and the trailer should be considered “connected” to the tractor for purposes of § II.A.1.C. This interpretation is consistent with the parties’ intent to provide coverage to the lessor of a covered auto being used in the lessee’s business. Therefore, whether Heinis was covered by reason of § II.A.1.C. does not turn only on whether he unhooked the tractor and trailer to facilitate the trailer’s repair. Rather, the Supreme Court of North Dakota would consider the relevant question to be whether the tractor and the trailer were functioning as a paired unit when the accident occurred.\nThe Lease Agreement obligated Heinis to remain in “constant contact” with Avery’s dispatcher and to respond to dispatches within a reasonable time. The record reflects that, every time Heinis transported a load as Avery’s lessor, he drove the same tractor pulling the same trailer. After entering into the lease, Heinis did not use the tractor-trailer rig for any purpose other than hauling loads for Avery. In these circumstances, the tractor and trailer were a functional unit consisting of two types of covered autos being used in Avery’s business.\nThe lease required Heinis to maintain the trailer in safe operating condition and to perform all repairs and maintenance in a timely manner. After discovering the leak, Heinis used a bucket to prevent spills while loading and unloading contaminated drilling water for Avery. He then called Kevin Avery and arranged to have the leak fixed at Avery’s shop before the tractor and trailer would be dispatched on another job.- Thus, in repairing the tractor, Heinis was executing his contractual duties and, as the explosion tragically confirmed, eliminating an unsafe condition before continuing to transport loads under the Lease Agreement. The tractor and trailer arrived at Avery’s repair shop as a unit and were unhooked only to facilitate repair the lease required. Momentarily unhooking the trailer to make a necessary repair did not render the trailer “not connected” to the tractor. On these undisputed facts, we conclude that Heinis’s tractor was “connected” to a covered auto power unit for the purposes of § II.A.1.C. of National’s policy. Therefore, Heinis was an “insured” to whom the liability coverage provided by National’s policy applied to Miller’s claim that Heinis’s negligence caused the explosion.\nB. Did a Policy Exclusion Apply? National argues that, even if its policy provided Heinis coverage for the accident that injured Miller, the “employer’s liability” and “fellow employee” exclusions precluded coverage. Section II.B.5. of National’s policy, the “Fellow Employee” exclusion, excluded coverage for “[bjodily injury to ... [a]ny fellow employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of the fellow employee’s employment or while performing duties related to the conduct of your business.” National argued that Heinis was an employee of Avery, and therefore a fellow employee of Miller, because the definition of employee in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (“FMCSRs”) should replace any contrary definitions in its policy or in state law. The district court, noting that the Supreme Court of North Dakota has not considered this question, and that other jurisdictions have reached conflicting conclusions, held that the FMCSRs did not apply, and even if they did, Hein-is was not an employee under the FMCSRs. Great W., 53 F.Supp.3d at 1178-88. Applying North Dakota’s rule requiring courts to construe ambiguous exclusions strictly against the insurer, the district court found no reason to depart from the plain meaning of the definition in National’s policy or to assume that the FMCSRs were implicitly incorporated. Great W, 53 F.Supp.3d at 1187.\nSection II.B.4.a. of National’s policy, the “Employer’s Liability” exclusion, excluded coverage for “[b]odily injury to ... [a]n employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of (1) Employment by the insured; or (2) Performing the duties related to the conduct of the insured’s business.” National argued that, if Heinis was an additional “insured,” this provision excluded coverage because the bodily injury caused by the covered accident was suffered by Miller, an employee of the named insured. National cited our decision in Farmers Elevator Mutual Insurance Co. v. Carl J. Austad & Sons, Inc., 366 F.2d 555 (8th Cir.1966), as controlling on this issue of North Dakota law. The district court disagreed because the policy in Farmers lacked a “severability clause,” and the presence of this clause created an ambiguity that must be resolved against National in construing this exclusion. In its only decision considering this issue, the Supreme Court of North Dakota “observed that the jurisdictions that have attempted to reconcile severability clauses and exclusionary clauses have not done so uniformly,” and concluded that “the ambiguity here is resolved by applying the rules for interpreting contracts, contained in NDCC Chapter 9-07.” Norgard, 518 N.W.2d at 182-83.\nWe agree with the district court that neither exclusion applied. But unlike the district court, we conclude the Supreme Court of North Dakota would apply the analysis mandated by Norgard equally to both exclusions. National does not (and could not) challenge the district court’s conclusion that the interpretation of the exclusions is governed by state law. Applying North Dakota common law to the Lease Agreement, it appears that Heinis was acting as Avery’s independent contractor, not its employee, at the time of the accident. See generally Doan ex rel. Doan v. City of Bismarck, 632 N.W.2d 815, 821 (N.D.2001); Iverson v. Bronco Drilling Co., Inc., 667 F.Supp.2d 1089, 1094 (D.N.D.2009); see also 49 C.F.R. § 376.12(c)(4) (“[njothing in the provisions required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section is intended to affect whether the lessor or driver provided by the lessor is an independent contractor or an employee of the authorized carrier lessee”).\nThe fellow employee and employer’s liability exclusions limit the policy coverage to liabilities that are not excluded by the remedy of workers’ compensation benefits. Workers’ compensation benefits are an injured employee’s exclusive remedy against his employer and fellow employees for an injury arising out of and in the course of employment. See, e.g., N.D. Cent.Code §§ 65-01-01, 65-01-08.1; Mitchell v. Sanborn, 536 N.W.2d 678, 683 (N.D.1995). By statute, an “employee” may recover workers’ compensation benefits from an “employer,” but not from “an independent contractor under the common-law test,” § 65-01-02.17. An injured employee may “proceed at law to recover damages” that a third person is liable to pay, including an independent contractor of the employer. If the employee has received workers’ compensation benefits, the North Dakota Workforce Safety & Insurance Organization “is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee” and has a lien that “attaches to all ... insurance payable by reason of a legal liability of a third person.” § 65-01-09.\nMiller’s lawsuit is premised on these statutory principles — he received workers’ compensation benefits as Avery’s employee and sued Heinis for negligence. If Heinis was acting as a common law independent contractor, North Dakota law will apparently permit Miller to recover in the negligence action. If Heinis is denied coverage under National’s policy by reason of either exclusion — because the FMCSR definition of employee applies, or because an insurer’s liability to additional insureds may not exceed that afforded the named insured — and if coverage is also excluded under Great West’s “bobtail” insurance, then Miller and the Workforce Safety & Insurance Organization will likely find any damages recovered in the negligence action uncollectible. Of course, no North Dakota statute or judicial precedent precludes this result. But we conclude the Supreme Court of North Dakota would find it inconsistent with the policies underlying the workers’ compensation statutes and therefore with the parties’ intent reflected in the insurance contract. See Blaskowski v. N.D. Workmen’s Comp. Bureau, 380 N.W.2d 333, 335 (N.D.1986) (“The purpose of the Bureau’s subrogation rights is to reimburse the fund ... at the expense of the persons at fault.”). In these circumstances, applying Norgard, the Court would rule that these exclusions, read together with the severability clause, do not apply to relieve National of the duty to defend additional-insured Heinis from a negligence action by the named insured’s employee. National’s duty to indemnify Heinis, if any, must of course await the outcome of Miller’s lawsuit.\nIII. Whether Great West’s Policy Provided Coverage to Heinis\nThe district court held that Great West’s policy excluded coverage for Heinis in Miller’s underlying state court lawsuit because the trailer was a covered auto being used “in the business of’ Avery, a person “to whom the ‘auto’ is rented, leased or loaned.” Great W., 53 F.Supp.3d at 1189-90. We agree.\nWe have found no North Dakota Supreme Court decision interpreting “in the business of’ in this context. In National Continental Insurance Co. v. Empire Fire & Marine Insurance Co., 157 F.3d 610 (8th Cir.1998), the owner-operator of a tractor under permanent lease to a trucking company was sued by persons injured in an accident that occurred while he was driving the tractor in for scheduled maintenance. The trucking company’s insurer sued the operator’s “nontrucking” liability insurer to recover settlement damages and litigation costs. Applying Oregon law, we concluded that, in construing the defendant insurer’s exclusion for damages while a covered auto is “used in the business of’ the lessee, the question was whether the independent contractor “was acting within the scope of the service contract with [the lessee] — in other words, whether he was fulfilling his bargained-for contractual duties at the time of the accident. To the extent that he was executing his contractual duties, he was clearly acting ‘in the business of [the lessee].” Nat’l Cont’l, 157 F.3d at 612, citing Hartford, 908 F.2d at 239.\nWhile not controlling authorities, we agree with the district court that the Supreme Court of North Dakota would adopt the reasoning of National Continental and Hartford and look to the terms of the Lease Agreement between Heinis and Avery to determine whether, at the time of the accident, Heinis was performing his contractual duties and therefore the trailer was being used in Avery’s business. The Lease Agreement required Heinis to maintain the trailer in safe operating condition, to perform all repairs and maintenance in a timely manner, and to comply with all federal motor carrier safety regulations. After Heinis finished a haul for Avery in which he used a bucket to prevent spills of contaminated water, Heinis contacted Kevin Avery and arranged to have the leak repaired before Heinis was again dispatched. In having the tractor repaired, Heinis executed his contractual duties and therefore was acting in Avery’s business at the time of the accident.\nNational argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment on this issue because the phrase “in the business of’ is an ambiguity that must be construed against the insurer, Great West. National notes that various courts have interpreted the phrase to apply when the driver is “under dispatch,” is acting at the specific direction of the carrier, or is engaged in an “operational routine.” However, that a contract term is subject to conflicting interpretations does not make it ambiguous as a matter of law. Moreover, the Supreme Court of South Dakota “would be reluctant to apply the general rule construing ambiguities liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against an insurer in a dispute between insurance companies.” St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Schilling, 520 N.W.2d 884, 889 (S.D.1994).\nUnder North Dakota and South Dakota law, the meaning of an insurance policy is determined based on contractual intent and the objectives of the parties as expressed in the contract. Trucking and bobtail insurance policies are intended to ensure there is liability coverage when leased equipment is used for both trucking and non-trucking activities. The focus in National Continental and Hartford on the lessor’s bargained — for contractual duties at the time of the accident is consistent with that purpose. We conclude that the Supreme Courts of North Dakota and South Dakota would interpret the Great West bobtail policy to exclude coverage for an accident that occurred while the equipment was being used “in the business of’ the trucking company lessee and was covered by the lessee’s liability insurer. That is the situation presented in this case, We therefore affirm the district court’s ruling that Miller’s claim against Heinis was not covered by the Great West policy.\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n. The Honorable Charles S. Miller, Jr., United States Magistrate Judge for the District of North Dakota.\n. A motor vehicle policy that excludes coverage when the vehicle is operating \""in the business of” a lessee is commonly known as \""bobtail” insurance. Federal law requires interstate motor carriers, but not equipment lessors, to maintain minimum levels of liability insurance. Thus, this term of the lease agreement and the terms of Great West’s bobtail policy are issues of state law. See Hartford Ins. Co. v. Occidental Fire & Cas. Co., 908 F.2d 235, 237 & n. 3 (7th Cir.1990).\n. The district court relied on the decision in Freed v. Travelers, 300 F.2d 395, 398 (7th Cir.1962) (explaining that \""the procurement of repairs incident to lessor’s duty to hold the tractor ready at all times for the services of the lessee is to be regarded as an activity exclusively in the business of the lessee”) (quotation omitted). But Freed was premised on an Interstate Commerce Commission order ' mandating that leases provide for the exclusive possession, use, and control of leased equipment by the lessee. Id. Motor carrier transportation has been significantly deregulated, and the regulation requiring this provision is now subject to exemptions. See 49 C.F.R. § 376.12(c)(1). The Lease Agreement did not contain a provision giving lessee Aveiy exclusive possession, use, and control of leased equipment. Neither the parties nor the district court addressed the significance of this omission in applying the policy term \""exclusively” to the facts of this case.\n. The FMCSRs define \""employee” as \""any individual, other than an employer, who is employed by an employer and who in the course of his or her employment directly affects commercial motor vehicle safety. Such term includes a driver of a commercial motor vehicle (including an independent contractor while in the course of operating a commercial motor vehicle), a mechanic, and a freight handler.” 49 C.F.R. § 390.5.\n. National's policy provided that, \""Except with respect to the Limit of Insurance, the coverage afforded applies separately to each insured who is seeking coverage or against whom a claim or suit is brought.”\n. In so ruling, the court disregarded our decision in Universal Underwriters Insurance Co. v. McMahon Chevrolet-Oldsmobile, Inc., 866 F.2d 1060, 1064 (8th Cir.1989), where we concluded that, despite the policy’s severability clause, the Supreme Court of South Dakota would not “extend[] an insurer’s liability to additional insureds above and beyond that afforded to the named insured.”\n. In other words, consistent with North Dakota workers’ compensation principles, the Court would read the severability clause in National's policy as excluding coverage only when an injured employee brings a negligence claim against his own employer or fellow employee. Here, under North Dakota common law, Heinis was not Miller’s fellow employee at Avery, nor was he Miller’s employer.\n. National argues that South Dakota law governs this issue because Heinis is a South Dakota resident and Great West issued its policy there. This is a dubious choice-of-law contention given the dispute's ties to North Dakota, but in any event we conclude the Supreme Court of South Dakota would apply the same analysis. National has not argued that South Dakota law differs from North Dakota law in any relevant respect."",""type"":""majority""}],""judges"":[""Before LOKEN, MELLOY, and GRUENDER, Circuit Judges.""],""head_matter"":""GREAT WEST CASUALTY COMPANY, Plaintiff-Appellee v.

In April 2011, independent owner-operator Steven Heinis leased his Volvo semi-tractor and Trailmobile tanker-trailer to Avery Enterprises (“Avery”), a trucking firm providing services to the oil and gas industry in the Bakken oilfields in North Dakota. On June 18, Heinis drove the tractor-trailer rig to Avery’s shop in Powers Lake, North Dakota, to repair a crack in the loading valve or pipe on Heinis’s trailer. When Jesse Miller, a shop employee, contacted the pipe with his welding torch, an explosion occurred, injuring Miller, who received workers’ compensation benefits from the North Dakota Workforce Safety & Insurance Organization and filed a state court negligence action against Heinis. See N.D. Cent.Code Ch. 65-02, § 65-01-09.\nAt the time in question, Great West Casualty Company (“Great West”) was Heinis’s commercial lines liability insurer, and National Casualty Company (“National”) was Avery’s commercial motor carrier liability insurer. Great West filed this declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that National is contractually obligated to defend and indemnify Heinis in Miller’s pending state court lawsuit and Great West is not. National’s Amended Answer asserted contrary positions. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Great West, concluding that Miller’s negligence claim against Heinis was covered under National’s policy and excluded under Great West’s policy. Great W. Cas. Co. v. Nat’l Cas. Co., 53 F.Supp.3d 1154, 1190 (D.N.D.2014). National appeals. Though the parties have argued other issues, to resolve the appeal we need only determine (i) that Heinis was an “insured” under the National policy, (ii) that neither of two exclusions in the National policy applied, and (iii) that the exclusion in Great West’s policy applied. Reviewing these issues de novo, we affirm.\nI. Background\nThe April 2011 Lease Agreement provided that Avery would dispatch Heinis to haul fresh water to drilling sites and contaminated “flowback” water from drilling sites to disposal facilities. Avery dispatched and paid Heinis on a per-job basis. The lease required Heinis to remain in “constant contact” with Avery and to respond to dispatches within a reasonable amount of time. Heinis hauled only for Avery from the commencement of the lease until the June 2011 accident. Heinis agreed to maintain the tractor and trailer in good and safe operational condition, to comply with federal motor carrier safety regulations, and to be responsible for the cost of repairs, maintenance, and fuel. The lease required Avery to maintain “fleet cargo and liability insurance” for the equipment, and required Heinis to maintain “property and casualty insurance (bobtail) for the leased equipment.” At the time of the accident, Avery’s name and DOT motor carrier numbers were affixed to the tractor.\nSome days prior to the accident, Heinis noticed a leak from the trailer’s valve or pipe during loading and unloading. After using a bucket to prevent spills while loading and unloading at least one load of contaminated water, Heinis called Kevin Avery the day before the accident and arranged to have the leak repaired at Avery’s repair shop. It is undisputed that the repair was Heinis’s responsibility under the Lease Agreement and that Heinis was not required to have the repair done at Avery’s shop. The next day, Heinis testified, he backed the trailer into the shop, unhooked the trailer before Miller undertook the repair, and rehooked the trailer after the explosion to pull it away from the scene. Kevin Avery testified that the tractor and trailer were hooked together when he ran out of his office after hearing the explosion.\nMiller sued Heinis to recover damages for the serious injuries Miller sustained while undertaking, at Avery’s shop, repairs that were Heinis’s responsibility under the lease. Whether Miller’s claims are covered under Avery’s policy with National and/or under Heinis’s policy with Great West requires us to review de novo the district court’s interpretation of these insurance contracts, as well as its decision to grant summary judgment. See Land O’ Lakes, Inc. v. Empl’rs Ins. Co. of Wausau, 728 F.3d 822, 827 (8th Cir.2013).\nII. Whether National’s Policy Provided Coverage to Heinis\nNational’s policy provided coverage to an insured for “ ‘bodily injur/ or ‘property damage’ to which this insurance applies, caused by an ‘accident’ and resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of a covered ‘auto.’ ” National argues there was no coverage because the “Who Is An Insured” provision did not include Heinis, and because two exclusions applied. The parties do not challenge the district court’s determination that North Dakota law governs these issues. Great W., 53 F.Supp.3d at 1159. Under North Dakota law:\nThe interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law, fully reviewable on appeal.

Section II.A.1.C. of National’s Motor Carrier Coverage Form provided that Who Is An Insured included:\nc. The owner or anyone else from whom you [Avery] hire or borrow a covered “auto” that is a “trailer” while the “trailer” is connected to another covered “auto” that is a power unit, or, if not connected, is being used exclusively in your business.\nIt is undisputed that Heinis’s leased tractor was a covered auto “power unit” and that Miller’s injuries resulted from an accident during “maintenance or use” of the leased trailer. Great West argued that Heinis was an insured because the trailer was a covered auto under § II.A.1.C. National argued that § II.A.1.C. did not apply because the accident occurred when the tractor and trailer were not “connected” and the trailer was not being used exclusively in Avery’s business. The district court concluded that § II.A.1.C. applied because the trailer was being used exclusively in Avery’s business at the time of the accident. Great W., 53 F.Supp.3d at 1162-71. We need not reach that question because we conclude that, even if the trailer was not being used exclusively in Aver/s business at the time of the accident, it was “connected to another covered ‘auto’ that is a power unit.”\nNational argues that § II.A.1.C. did not provide coverage because “connected” required that the trailer be physically attached to a covered power unit when the accident occurred, and Heinis testified that he unhooked the tractor and trailer before Miller began the repairs. We agree with the district court that whether the tractor and trailer were physically attached when the explosion occurred was at least a disputed issue of fact. At the summary judgment stage, we must view the facts in favor of the non-moving party, and therefore we assume the trailer was physically unhooked at the moment the explosion occurred. See, e.g., Watkins Inc. v. Chilkoot Distrib., Inc., 655 F.3d 802, 803 (8th Cir.2011). Büt we conclude this is not a material fact dispute that precludes the grant of summary judgment. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).\nWe are unaware of any case, from North Dakota or any jurisdiction, that has interpreted the word “connected” in this context. Thus, we must determine how the Supreme Court of North Dakota would resolve the issue. See, e.g., Hudson Specialty Ins. Co. v. Brash Tygr, LLC, 769 F.3d 586, 591 (8th Cir.2014). That Court would “look first to the language of the insurance contract, and if the policy language is clear on its face, there is no room for construction. If coverage hinges on an undefined term, we apply the plain, ordinary meaning of the term in interpreting the contract.” Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Decker, 704 N.W.2d 857, 860 (N.D.2005).

Code § 9-07-12.\nBecause National’s policy does not define the term “connected,” we must give the term its plain, ordinary meaning. Webster’s Third New International Dictionary defines “connected” as including objects “joined or linked together,” or “having the parts or elements logically related,” at 480 (1986). This definition includes objects that are physically attached, but the words “linked” and “logically related” do not require physical attachment. So the term as used in § II.A.1.C. needs to be defined by reference to “the matter to which it relates.”\nA commercial tractor and trailer need not operate as a single unit. The trailer can be unhitched and hauled by other tractors operating for different owners or lessees under different contracts. When the tractor is a “covered auto,” this provision was obviously intended to exclude coverage for accidents arising from use of a companion trailer when the trailer is operated separately from the tractor and the insured’s business. But when a scheduled trailer is “connected,” that is, functioning as a unit with a scheduled tractor, both are covered autos. There clearly are times when a trailer is briefly unhooked from a tractor for a reason that is consistent with the trailer’s status as a covered auto. For example, the driver performing a haul for the insured may briefly detach the trailer to save fuel while he drives to a nearby filling station to refuel the tractor.

On these undisputed facts, we conclude that Heinis’s tractor was “connected” to a covered auto power unit for the purposes of § II.A.1.C. of National’s policy. Therefore, Heinis was an “insured” to whom the liability coverage provided by National’s policy applied to Miller’s claim that Heinis’s negligence caused the explosion.\nB. Did a Policy Exclusion Apply? National argues that, even if its policy provided Heinis coverage for the accident that injured Miller, the “employer’s liability” and “fellow employee” exclusions precluded coverage. Section II.B.5. of National’s policy, the “Fellow Employee” exclusion, excluded coverage for “[bjodily injury to ... [a]ny fellow employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of the fellow employee’s employment or while performing duties related to the conduct of your business.” National argued that Heinis was an employee of Avery, and therefore a fellow employee of Miller, because the definition of employee in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (“FMCSRs”) should replace any contrary definitions in its policy or in state law. The district court, noting that the Supreme Court of North Dakota has not considered this question, and that other jurisdictions have reached conflicting conclusions, held that the FMCSRs did not apply, and even if they did, Hein-is was not an employee under the FMCSRs. Great W., 53 F.Supp.3d at 1178-88. Applying North Dakota’s rule requiring courts to construe ambiguous exclusions strictly against the insurer, the district court found no reason to depart from the plain meaning of the definition in National’s policy or to assume that the FMCSRs were implicitly incorporated. Great W, 53 F.Supp.3d at 1187.\nSection II.B.4.a. of National’s policy, the “Employer’s Liability” exclusion, excluded coverage for “[b]odily injury to ... [a]n employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of (1) Employment by the insured; or (2) Performing the duties related to the conduct of the insured’s business.” National argued that, if Heinis was an additional “insured,” this provision excluded coverage because the bodily injury caused by the covered accident was suffered by Miller, an employee of the named insured. National cited our decision in Farmers Elevator Mutual Insurance Co. v. Carl J. Austad & Sons, Inc., 366 F.2d 555 (8th Cir.1966), as controlling on this issue of North Dakota law. The district court disagreed because the policy in Farmers lacked a “severability clause,” and the presence of this clause created an ambiguity that must be resolved against National in construing this exclusion. In its only decision considering this issue, the Supreme Court of North Dakota “observed that the jurisdictions that have attempted to reconcile severability clauses and exclusionary clauses have not done so uniformly,” and concluded that “the ambiguity here is resolved by applying the rules for interpreting contracts, contained in NDCC Chapter 9-07.” Norgard, 518 N.W.2d at 182-83.\nWe agree with the district court that neither exclusion applied. But unlike the district court, we conclude the Supreme Court of North Dakota would apply the analysis mandated by Norgard equally to both exclusions. National does not (and could not) challenge the district court’s conclusion that the interpretation of the exclusions is governed by state law. Applying North Dakota common law to the Lease Agreement, it appears that Heinis was acting as Avery’s independent contractor, not its employee, at the time of the accident. See generally Doan ex rel. Doan v. City of Bismarck, 632 N.W.2d 815, 821 (N.D.2001); Iverson v. Bronco Drilling Co., Inc., 667 F.Supp.2d 1089, 1094 (D.N.D.2009); see also 49 C.F.R. § 376.12(c)(4) (“[njothing in the provisions required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section is intended to affect whether the lessor or driver provided by the lessor is an independent contractor or an employee of the authorized carrier lessee”).\nThe fellow employee and employer’s liability exclusions limit the policy coverage to liabilities that are not excluded by the remedy of workers’ compensation benefits. Workers’ compensation benefits are an injured employee’s exclusive remedy against his employer and fellow employees for an injury arising out of and in the course of employment. See, e.g., N.D. Cent.Code §§ 65-01-01, 65-01-08.1; Mitchell v. Sanborn, 536 N.W.2d 678, 683 (N.D.1995). By statute, an “employee” may recover workers’ compensation benefits from an “employer,” but not from “an independent contractor under the common-law test,” § 65-01-02.17. An injured employee may “proceed at law to recover damages” that a third person is liable to pay, including an independent contractor of the employer. If the employee has received workers’ compensation benefits, the North Dakota Workforce Safety & Insurance Organization “is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee” and has a lien that “attaches to all ... insurance payable by reason of a legal liability of a third person.” § 65-01-09.\nMiller’s lawsuit is premised on these statutory principles — he received workers’ compensation benefits as Avery’s employee and sued Heinis for negligence. If Heinis was acting as a common law independent contractor, North Dakota law will apparently permit Miller to recover in the negligence action. If Heinis is denied coverage under National’s policy by reason of either exclusion — because the FMCSR definition of employee applies, or because an insurer’s liability to additional insureds may not exceed that afforded the named insured — and if coverage is also excluded under Great West’s “bobtail” insurance, then Miller and the Workforce Safety & Insurance Organization will likely find any damages recovered in the negligence action uncollectible. Of course, no North Dakota statute or judicial precedent precludes this result. But we conclude the Supreme Court of North Dakota would find it inconsistent with the policies underlying the workers’ compensation statutes and therefore with the parties’ intent reflected in the insurance contract. See Blaskowski v. N.D. Workmen’s Comp. Bureau, 380 N.W.2d 333, 335 (N.D.1986) (“The purpose of the Bureau’s subrogation rights is to reimburse the fund ... at the expense of the persons at fault.”). In these circumstances, applying Norgard, the Court would rule that these exclusions, read together with the severability clause, do not apply to relieve National of the duty to defend additional-insured Heinis from a negligence action by the named insured’s employee. National’s duty to indemnify Heinis, if any, must of course await the outcome of Miller’s lawsuit.\nIII. Whether Great West’s Policy Provided Coverage to Heinis\nThe district court held that Great West’s policy excluded coverage for Heinis in Miller’s underlying state court lawsuit because the trailer was a covered auto being used “in the business of’ Avery, a person “to whom the ‘auto’ is rented, leased or loaned.” Great W., 53 F.Supp.3d at 1189-90. We agree.\nWe have found no North Dakota Supreme Court decision interpreting “in the business of’ in this context. In National Continental Insurance Co. v. Empire Fire & Marine Insurance Co., 157 F.3d 610 (8th Cir.1998), the owner-operator of a tractor under permanent lease to a trucking company was sued by persons injured in an accident that occurred while he was driving the tractor in for scheduled maintenance. The trucking company’s insurer sued the operator’s “nontrucking” liability insurer to recover settlement damages and litigation costs. Applying Oregon law, we concluded that, in construing the defendant insurer’s exclusion for damages while a covered auto is “used in the business of’ the lessee, the question was whether the independent contractor “was acting within the scope of the service contract with [the lessee] — in other words, whether he was fulfilling his bargained-for contractual duties at the time of the accident. To the extent that he was executing his contractual duties, he was clearly acting ‘in the business of [the lessee].” Nat’l Cont’l, 157 F.3d at 612, citing Hartford, 908 F.2d at 239.\nWhile not controlling authorities, we agree with the district court that the Supreme Court of North Dakota would adopt the reasoning of National Continental and Hartford and look to the terms of the Lease Agreement between Heinis and Avery to determine whether, at the time of the accident, Heinis was performing his contractual duties and therefore the trailer was being used in Avery’s business. The Lease Agreement required Heinis to maintain the trailer in safe operating condition, to perform all repairs and maintenance in a timely manner, and to comply with all federal motor carrier safety regulations. After Heinis finished a haul for Avery in which he used a bucket to prevent spills of contaminated water, Heinis contacted Kevin Avery and arranged to have the leak repaired before Heinis was again dispatched. In having the tractor repaired, Heinis executed his contractual duties and therefore was acting in Avery’s business at the time of the accident.\nNational argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment on this issue because the phrase “in the business of’ is an ambiguity that must be construed against the insurer, Great West. National notes that various courts have interpreted the phrase to apply when the driver is “under dispatch,” is acting at the specific direction of the carrier, or is engaged in an “operational routine.” However, that a contract term is subject to conflicting interpretations does not make it ambiguous as a matter of law. Moreover, the Supreme Court of South Dakota “would be reluctant to apply the general rule construing ambiguities liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against an insurer in a dispute between insurance companies.” St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Schilling, 520 N.W.2d 884, 889 (S.D.1994).\nUnder North Dakota and South Dakota law, the meaning of an insurance policy is determined based on contractual intent and the objectives of the parties as expressed in the contract. Trucking and bobtail insurance policies are intended to ensure there is liability coverage when leased equipment is used for both trucking and non-trucking activities. The focus in National Continental and Hartford on the lessor’s bargained — for contractual duties at the time of the accident is consistent with that purpose. We conclude that the Supreme Courts of North Dakota and South Dakota would interpret the Great West bobtail policy to exclude coverage for an accident that occurred while the equipment was being used “in the business of’ the trucking company lessee and was covered by the lessee’s liability insurer. That is the situation presented in this case, We therefore affirm the district court’s ruling that Miller’s claim against Heinis was not covered by the Great West policy.\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n. The Honorable Charles S. Miller, Jr., United States Magistrate Judge for the District of North Dakota.\n. A motor vehicle policy that excludes coverage when the vehicle is operating ""in the business of” a lessee is commonly known as ""bobtail” insurance. Federal law requires interstate motor carriers, but not equipment lessors, to maintain minimum levels of liability insurance. Thus, this term of the lease agreement and the terms of Great West’s bobtail policy are issues of state law. See Hartford Ins. Co. v. Occidental Fire & Cas. Co., 908 F.2d 235, 237 & n. 3 (7th Cir.1990).\n. The district court relied on the decision in Freed v. Travelers, 300 F.2d 395, 398 (7th Cir.1962) (explaining that ""the procurement of repairs incident to lessor’s duty to hold the tractor ready at all times for the services of the lessee is to be regarded as an activity exclusively in the business of the lessee”) (quotation omitted). But Freed was premised on an Interstate Commerce Commission order \' mandating that leases provide for the exclusive possession, use, and control of leased equipment by the lessee. Id. Motor carrier transportation has been significantly deregulated, and the regulation requiring this provision is now subject to exemptions. See 49 C.F.R. § 376.12(c)(1). The Lease Agreement did not contain a provision giving lessee Aveiy exclusive possession, use, and control of leased equipment. Neither the parties nor the district court addressed the significance of this omission in applying the policy term ""exclusively” to the facts of this case.\n. The FMCSRs define ""employee” as ""any individual, other than an employer, who is employed by an employer and who in the course of his or her employment directly affects commercial motor vehicle safety. Such term includes a driver of a commercial motor vehicle (including an independent contractor while in the course of operating a commercial motor vehicle), a mechanic, and a freight handler.” 49 C.F.R. § 390.5.\n. National\'s policy provided that, ""Except with respect to the Limit of Insurance, the coverage afforded applies separately to each insured who is seeking coverage or against whom a claim or suit is brought.”\n. In so ruling, the court disregarded our decision in Universal Underwriters Insurance Co. v. McMahon Chevrolet-Oldsmobile, Inc., 866 F.2d 1060, 1064 (8th Cir.1989), where we concluded that, despite the policy’s severability clause, the Supreme Court of South Dakota would not “extend[] an insurer’s liability to additional insureds above and beyond that afforded to the named insured.”\n. In other words, consistent with North Dakota workers’ compensation principles, the Court would read the severability clause in National\'s policy as excluding coverage only when an injured employee brings a negligence claim against his own employer or fellow employee. Here, under North Dakota common law, Heinis was not Miller’s fellow employee at Avery, nor was he Miller’s employer.\n. National argues that South Dakota law governs this issue because Heinis is a South Dakota resident and Great West issued its policy there. This is a dubious choice-of-law contention given the dispute\'s ties to North Dakota, but in any event we conclude the Supreme Court of South Dakota would apply the same analysis. National has not argued that South Dakota law differs from North Dakota law in any relevant respect.', 'type': 'majority'}]"

Scheindlin, U.S.D.J.:"",""text"":""OPINION AND ORDER\nShira A. Scheindlin, U.S.D.J.:\nThis is an appeal from an order entered in the jointly administered chapter 11 bankruptcy cases of appellees Genco Shipping & Trading Limited and related entities (together, “Genco”) disallowing the claims of appellants Fisher Brothers Management Co. LLC (“Fisher Management”) and Fisher-Park Lane Owner LLC (“Fisher-Park”). For the reasons set forth below, the Bankruptcy Court’s order disallowing appellants’ claims is VACATED and this matter is REMANDED to the Bankruptcy Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion and Order.\nI. BACKGROUND\nA. The Lease Documents\nThe facts relevant to this appeal are undisputed. Pursuant to a Master Lease dated September 22, 2005, Genco leased office space on the twentieth floor of 299 Park Avenue from Fisher-Park. In January 2012, Genco vacated the twentieth floor and moved its headquarters to the twelfth floor of the same building. Under a Sublease dated November 1, 2013, Genco subleased the twentieth-floor office space to Fisher Management. The annual rent payable to Genco under the Sublease was less than the annual rent Genco paid to Fisher-Park under the Master Lease.\nSection 5.1 of the Sublease provides that, “[i]f the [Master Lease] shall terminate for any reason this Sublease shall also terminate as of the date of termination of the [Master Lease], unless [Fisher-Park] otherwise agrees, and in no event shall [Genco] be liable therefor.” Section 5.1 also states that:\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, [Genco] may otherwise voluntarily terminate the [Master Lease] without [Fisher Management’s] consent if [Fisher-Park] agrees to assume and accept this Sublease in order to permit [Fisher Management] to remain in possession of the Subleased [premises as a direct tenant for the remainder of the term of the Sublease or pursuant to- a new direct lease between [Fisher-Park] and [Fisher Management].\nThe same day the Sublease was executed, Genco, Fisher-Park, and Fisher Management entered into a consent to the Sublease (the “Consent”) and a Subordination, Nondisturbance, and Attornment Agreement (the “SNDA Agreement”; together with the Master Lease, Sublease, and Consent, the “Lease Documents”). Recital 3 of the SNDA Agreement states that Fisher Management “was unwilling to enter into the Sublease absent [Fisher-Park’s] execution of [the SNDA Agreement] and [the C]onsent ... pursuant to which [Fisher-Park] has consented to the Sublease.” Section 2(b) of the SNDA provides that:\nIn the event the [Master] Lease terminates for any reason other than (i) the occurrence of a casualty or condemnation that results in the exercise by [Fisher-Park] of a termination right under the [Master] Lease or (ii) a default by [Fisher Management] or breach of [Fisher Management’s] obligations under the Sublease, then so long as [Fisher Management] is not then in default in the performance of any of its obligations under the Sublease ....\n[Fisher Management’s] subleasehold estate in the [twentieth floor] shall not be terminated or disturbed and the Sublease shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the Subleased Premises as a direct lease between [Fisher Management] and [Fisher-Park] upon all of the same terms, covenants, conditions and obligations of the Sublease (subject, however, to the other provisions of this Agreement) relative to the [twentieth floor] only, for the balance of the term thereof with the same force as if the Sublease were a direct lease between [Fisher-Park] and [Fisher Management]; provided, however, that, commencing oh the [date on which Fisher Management attorns to Fisher-Park and Fisher-Park recognizes the tenancy of Fisher Management], [Fisher Management] shall pay the greater of (x) the fixed annual rent and additional rent as provided in the Sublease, or (y) the fixed annual rent and additional rent as provided in the [Master Lease],\nB. Appellants’ Claims\nOn April 21, 2014, Genco commenced a chapter 11 bankruptcy case. That same day, Genco filed a motion to reject the Lease Documents. After a hearing, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the rejection (the “Lease Rejection Order”). This order was entered on consent of appellants.\nOn May 20, 2014, Fisher-Park filed a proof' of claim seeking an unspecified amount of unpaid rent as a consequence of the rejection of the Master Lease. That same day, Fisher Management filed a proof of claim seeking $1,614,130.33 in damages based on the additional rent it was required to pay following Genco’s rejection of the Sublease. Genco filed an objection to appellants’ claims.\nThe Bankruptcy Court issued a decision disallowing appellants’ claims in their entirety. It held that Fisher-Park had not suffered any damages because it had continued to receive — from Fisher Management — the full rental amount previously paid by Genco. It further held that Fisher Management did not have a claim for damages because it had received what it had bargained for under the Lease Documents — “the benefit of undisturbed occupancy, rather than [having to] face potential eviction .... ”\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nA district court functions as an appellate court in. reviewing orders entered by bankruptcy courts. Findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, whereas findings that involve questions of law, or mixed questions of fact and law, are reviewed de novo.\nIII. APPLICABLE LAW\nA. Lease Rejection and Claim Allowance\nUnder section -365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, “subject to the court’s approval, [the debtor-in-possession] may assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor.” Subsection (g) states that “the rejection of an executo-ry contract or unexpired lease of the debt- or constitutes a breach of such contract or lease ... [which is deemed to occur] immediately before the date of the filing of the petition —” As explained by. the Second Circuit:\nRejection gives rise to a remedy for breach of contract in the non-debtor party. The claim is treated as a pre-petition claim, affording creditors their proper priority. Under sections 365(g) and 502(g), the date of breach is set as the date immediately prior to the debtor’s filing for bankruptcy. See also 4 Collier § 502.08[2], The Bankruptcy Code treats rejection as a breach so that the non-debtor party will have a viable claim against the debtor. However, the Code does not determine parties’ rights regarding the contract and subsequent breach. To determine these rights, we must turn to state law.\nSection 502(g)(l)states that:\nA claim arising from the rejection, under section 365 of this title or under a plan under chapter 9, 11, 12, or 13 of this title, of an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor that has not been assumed shall be determined, and shall be allowed under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section or disallowed under subsection (d) or (e) of this section, the same as if such claim had arisen before the date of the filing of the petition.\nSection 101(5)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code defines “claim” as a “right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured ....” Under section 501(a), “a creditor ... may file a proof of claim,” and under section 502(a), such claim will be deemed allowed unless an objection is filed. One basis for sustaining an objection and disallowing a claim is that “such claim is unenforceable against the debtor and property of the debtor, under any agreement or applicable law for a reason other than because such claim is contingent or unmatured .... ” “Applicable law” most often refers to state law.\nB. Contract Interpretation\nUnder New York law, “[t]he court’s function in interpreting a contract is to apply the meaning intended by the parties, as derived from the language of the contract in question;” “[T]he best evidence of what parties to a written agreement intend is what they say in their writing. Thus, a written agreement that is complete, clear and unambiguous on its face must be enforced according to the plain meaning of its terms.”\n“The question of whether a written contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court.” “Contract language is unambiguous when it has a definite and precise meaning, unattended by danger of misconception in the purport of the contract itself, and concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion.” However, contract language is ambiguous if “the terms of the contract could suggest more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs, practices, usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.”\nIY. DISCUSSION\nAppellants argue that because (1) section 365(g)(1) states that a rejection constitutes a breach and (2) it is axiomatic that a breach entitles the non-breaching party to a remedy (whether or not the governing contract specifically provides for such remedy), they are entitled to damages. Appellants concede “that common law damages for breach of contract are not recoverable where the contract at issue anticipates the possible occurrence of such breach and provides for a specific remedy in the event of such occurrence.” According to appellants, however, “there is nothing contained in any of the Lease Documents that even remotely contemplates a unilateral breach by Genco of the Sublease or disclaims damages therefor in the event such unilateral breach ever occurred.”\nAccording to the Bankruptcy Court, two provisions of the Lease Documents “compelled] the conclusion that Genco is not obligated to pay any amounts sought in the two Claims.” The Bankruptcy Court believed that “[s]ection 2 of the SNDA specifically addresses the exact circumstances now before the Court. It makes clear that, where the Master Lease is terminated, but the subtenant [ ] stays in the premises, the subtenant must pay the full amount of the rent.” The Bankruptcy Court also relied on section 5.1 of the Sublease, which provides that “[i]f the [Master Lease] shall terminate for any reason this Sublease shall also terminate as of the date of the termination of the [Master Lease], unless [Fisher-Park] otherwise agrees, and in no event shall [Genco] be liable therefor.”\nHowever, the Second Circuit explains that “[w]hile rejection [under section 365(g)(1)] is treated as a breach, it does not completely terminate the contract. Thus, rejection merely frees the estate from the obligation to perform; it does not make the contract disappear.” It follows that the Master Lease (and the other Lease Documents) were not “terminated” solely by virtue of Genco’s rejection of those agreements. Accordingly, the Bankruptcy Court has either erred by equating rejection with termination or by failing to make a finding of fact that Genco terminated either the Master Lease or the Sublease. As a consequence, it is unclear whether or not the termination language in section 2 of the SNDA and section 5.1 of the Sublease apply to this case. Likewise, the Bankruptcy Court failed to address “breach” under section 365(g)(1) and whether and to what extent the Lease Documents contemplated a breach by Gen-co.\nBecause it is unclear from the Bankruptcy Court Opinion, and from the order itself, to what extent the Bankruptcy Court relied on erroneous legal conclusions or findings of fact in ruling on the claim objections, the Bankruptcy Court’s order must be vacated. On remand the Bankruptcy Court is directed to address appellants’ arguments — based on section 365(g)(1) and the Lease Documents — that the rejection of the Lease Documents “constituted .... a breach of the Sublease by Genco, thereby entitling [ ] Fisher Management to damages arising from' such breach.” In so doing, the Bankruptcy Court should consider the meaning of “breach” in section 365(g)(1), the interplay between such a breach and determining a claim under section 502(g)(1), and the defenses to liability for breach of a lease under New York law. The Bankruptcy Court is further directed to determine the damages, if any, arising from Genco’s breach of the parties’ agreements. In addition to the above, the Bankruptcy Court may address any other issues it deems necessary to resolving the claims objections,\nV. CONCLUSION\nAccordingly, the Bankruptcy Court’s order disallowing appellants’ claims is VACATED and this matter is REMANDED to the Bankruptcy Court, for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion and Order.

Scheindlin, U.S.D.J.:', 'text': 'OPINION AND ORDER\nShira A. Scheindlin, U.S.D.J.:\nThis is an appeal from an order entered in the jointly administered chapter 11 bankruptcy cases of appellees Genco Shipping & Trading Limited and related entities (together, “Genco”) disallowing the claims of appellants Fisher Brothers Management Co. LLC (“Fisher Management”) and Fisher-Park Lane Owner LLC (“Fisher-Park”). For the reasons set forth below, the Bankruptcy Court’s order disallowing appellants’ claims is VACATED and this matter is REMANDED to the Bankruptcy Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion and Order.\nI. BACKGROUND\nA. The Lease Documents\nThe facts relevant to this appeal are undisputed. Pursuant to a Master Lease dated September 22, 2005, Genco leased office space on the twentieth floor of 299 Park Avenue from Fisher-Park. In January 2012, Genco vacated the twentieth floor and moved its headquarters to the twelfth floor of the same building. Under a Sublease dated November 1, 2013, Genco subleased the twentieth-floor office space to Fisher Management. The annual rent payable to Genco under the Sublease was less than the annual rent Genco paid to Fisher-Park under the Master Lease.\nSection 5.1 of the Sublease provides that, “[i]f the [Master Lease] shall terminate for any reason this Sublease shall also terminate as of the date of termination of the [Master Lease], unless [Fisher-Park] otherwise agrees, and in no event shall [Genco] be liable therefor.” Section 5.1 also states that:\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, [Genco] may otherwise voluntarily terminate the [Master Lease] without [Fisher Management’s] consent if [Fisher-Park] agrees to assume and accept this Sublease in order to permit [Fisher Management] to remain in possession of the Subleased [premises as a direct tenant for the remainder of the term of the Sublease or pursuant to- a new direct lease between [Fisher-Park] and [Fisher Management].\nThe same day the Sublease was executed, Genco, Fisher-Park, and Fisher Management entered into a consent to the Sublease (the “Consent”) and a Subordination, Nondisturbance, and Attornment Agreement (the “SNDA Agreement”; together with the Master Lease, Sublease, and Consent, the “Lease Documents”). Recital 3 of the SNDA Agreement states that Fisher Management “was unwilling to enter into the Sublease absent [Fisher-Park’s] execution of [the SNDA Agreement] and [the C]onsent ... pursuant to which [Fisher-Park] has consented to the Sublease.” Section 2(b) of the SNDA provides that:\nIn the event the [Master] Lease terminates for any reason other than (i) the occurrence of a casualty or condemnation that results in the exercise by [Fisher-Park] of a termination right under the [Master] Lease or (ii) a default by [Fisher Management] or breach of [Fisher Management’s] obligations under the Sublease, then so long as [Fisher Management] is not then in default in the performance of any of its obligations under the Sublease ....\n[Fisher Management’s] subleasehold estate in the [twentieth floor] shall not be terminated or disturbed and the Sublease shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the Subleased Premises as a direct lease between [Fisher Management] and [Fisher-Park] upon all of the same terms, covenants, conditions and obligations of the Sublease (subject, however, to the other provisions of this Agreement) relative to the [twentieth floor] only, for the balance of the term thereof with the same force as if the Sublease were a direct lease between [Fisher-Park] and [Fisher Management]; provided, however, that, commencing oh the [date on which Fisher Management attorns to Fisher-Park and Fisher-Park recognizes the tenancy of Fisher Management], [Fisher Management] shall pay the greater of (x) the fixed annual rent and additional rent as provided in the Sublease, or (y) the fixed annual rent and additional rent as provided in the [Master Lease],\nB. Appellants’ Claims\nOn April 21, 2014, Genco commenced a chapter 11 bankruptcy case. That same day, Genco filed a motion to reject the Lease Documents. After a hearing, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the rejection (the “Lease Rejection Order”). This order was entered on consent of appellants.\nOn May 20, 2014, Fisher-Park filed a proof\' of claim seeking an unspecified amount of unpaid rent as a consequence of the rejection of the Master Lease. That same day, Fisher Management filed a proof of claim seeking $1,614,130.33 in damages based on the additional rent it was required to pay following Genco’s rejection of the Sublease. Genco filed an objection to appellants’ claims.\nThe Bankruptcy Court issued a decision disallowing appellants’ claims in their entirety. It held that Fisher-Park had not suffered any damages because it had continued to receive — from Fisher Management — the full rental amount previously paid by Genco. It further held that Fisher Management did not have a claim for damages because it had received what it had bargained for under the Lease Documents — “the benefit of undisturbed occupancy, rather than [having to] face potential eviction .... ”\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nA district court functions as an appellate court in. reviewing orders entered by bankruptcy courts. Findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, whereas findings that involve questions of law, or mixed questions of fact and law, are reviewed de novo.\nIII. APPLICABLE LAW\nA. Lease Rejection and Claim Allowance\nUnder section -365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, “subject to the court’s approval, [the debtor-in-possession] may assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor.” Subsection (g) states that “the rejection of an executo-ry contract or unexpired lease of the debt- or constitutes a breach of such contract or lease ... [which is deemed to occur] immediately before the date of the filing of the petition —” As explained by. the Second Circuit:\nRejection gives rise to a remedy for breach of contract in the non-debtor party. The claim is treated as a pre-petition claim, affording creditors their proper priority. Under sections 365(g) and 502(g), the date of breach is set as the date immediately prior to the debtor’s filing for bankruptcy. See also 4 Collier § 502.08[2], The Bankruptcy Code treats rejection as a breach so that the non-debtor party will have a viable claim against the debtor. However, the Code does not determine parties’ rights regarding the contract and subsequent breach. To determine these rights, we must turn to state law.\nSection 502(g)(l)states that:\nA claim arising from the rejection, under section 365 of this title or under a plan under chapter 9, 11, 12, or 13 of this title, of an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor that has not been assumed shall be determined, and shall be allowed under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section or disallowed under subsection (d) or (e) of this section, the same as if such claim had arisen before the date of the filing of the petition.\nSection 101(5)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code defines “claim” as a “right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured ....” Under section 501(a), “a creditor ... may file a proof of claim,” and under section 502(a), such claim will be deemed allowed unless an objection is filed. One basis for sustaining an objection and disallowing a claim is that “such claim is unenforceable against the debtor and property of the debtor, under any agreement or applicable law for a reason other than because such claim is contingent or unmatured .... ” “Applicable law” most often refers to state law.\nB. Contract Interpretation\nUnder New York law, “[t]he court’s function in interpreting a contract is to apply the meaning intended by the parties, as derived from the language of the contract in question;” “[T]he best evidence of what parties to a written agreement intend is what they say in their writing. Thus, a written agreement that is complete, clear and unambiguous on its face must be enforced according to the plain meaning of its terms.”\n“The question of whether a written contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court.” “Contract language is unambiguous when it has a definite and precise meaning, unattended by danger of misconception in the purport of the contract itself, and concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion.” However, contract language is ambiguous if “the terms of the contract could suggest more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs, practices, usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.”\nIY. DISCUSSION\nAppellants argue that because (1) section 365(g)(1) states that a rejection constitutes a breach and (2) it is axiomatic that a breach entitles the non-breaching party to a remedy (whether or not the governing contract specifically provides for such remedy), they are entitled to damages. Appellants concede “that common law damages for breach of contract are not recoverable where the contract at issue anticipates the possible occurrence of such breach and provides for a specific remedy in the event of such occurrence.” According to appellants, however, “there is nothing contained in any of the Lease Documents that even remotely contemplates a unilateral breach by Genco of the Sublease or disclaims damages therefor in the event such unilateral breach ever occurred.”\nAccording to the Bankruptcy Court, two provisions of the Lease Documents “compelled] the conclusion that Genco is not obligated to pay any amounts sought in the two Claims.” The Bankruptcy Court believed that “[s]ection 2 of the SNDA specifically addresses the exact circumstances now before the Court. It makes clear that, where the Master Lease is terminated, but the subtenant [ ] stays in the premises, the subtenant must pay the full amount of the rent.” The Bankruptcy Court also relied on section 5.1 of the Sublease, which provides that “[i]f the [Master Lease] shall terminate for any reason this Sublease shall also terminate as of the date of the termination of the [Master Lease], unless [Fisher-Park] otherwise agrees, and in no event shall [Genco] be liable therefor.”\nHowever, the Second Circuit explains that “[w]hile rejection [under section 365(g)(1)] is treated as a breach, it does not completely terminate the contract.

Accordingly, the Bankruptcy Court has either erred by equating rejection with termination or by failing to make a finding of fact that Genco terminated either the Master Lease or the Sublease. As a consequence, it is unclear whether or not the termination language in section 2 of the SNDA and section 5.1 of the Sublease apply to this case. Likewise, the Bankruptcy Court failed to address “breach” under section 365(g)(1) and whether and to what extent the Lease Documents contemplated a breach by Gen-co.\nBecause it is unclear from the Bankruptcy Court Opinion, and from the order itself, to what extent the Bankruptcy Court relied on erroneous legal conclusions or findings of fact in ruling on the claim objections, the Bankruptcy Court’s order must be vacated. On remand the Bankruptcy Court is directed to address appellants’ arguments — based on section 365(g)(1) and the Lease Documents — that the rejection of the Lease Documents “constituted .... a breach of the Sublease by Genco, thereby entitling [ ] Fisher Management to damages arising from\' such breach.” In so doing, the Bankruptcy Court should consider the meaning of “breach” in section 365(g)(1), the interplay between such a breach and determining a claim under section 502(g)(1), and the defenses to liability for breach of a lease under New York law. The Bankruptcy Court is further directed to determine the damages, if any, arising from Genco’s breach of the parties’ agreements. In addition to the above, the Bankruptcy Court may address any other issues it deems necessary to resolving the claims objections,\nV.

The answer to that question is complicated by a dispute over the interpretation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act by the California Court of Appeal and whether that court’s decision is binding on federal courts in diversity cases. If it is, the consequence negatively impacts the trial court’s determination of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act in this case. There is also a concern about the warranties, focused on whether the language written by Ford is ambiguous. Finally, there is the question of whether the record here can be construed to show reliance in favor of the plaintiffs when they admittedly did not read available materials about the Ford Focus. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Ford. We reverse.\nI. Background\nThe plaintiffs, Margie Daniel, Mary Hauser, Donna Glass, and Andrea Duarte (collectively “Plaintiffs”), brought this class action against Ford, alleging that Ford breached implied and express warranties and committed fraud in the sale of model year 2005 to 2011 Ford Focus vehicles containing rear suspension defects. Plaintiffs purchased their Ford Focus vehicles from authorized Ford dealerships in California. With each purchase, Plaintiffs received a New Vehicle Limited Warranty. Prior to purchase, they did not research the Focus or view brochures, websites, or advertisements about the Focus. Nor did they read the warranty, maintenance, or owner’s guides that came with the new vehicles prior to purchasing them. However, Plaintiffs did speak to authorized Ford dealership sales representatives about the Focus when they made their purchases. After purchase, Plaintiffs’ Focuses required new rear tires for the first time between 12,086 and 20,723 miles.\nPlaintiffs allege that the Focus has a rear suspension “alignment/geometry” defect that leads to premature tire wear, which in turn leads to safety hazards such as decreased control in handling, steering, stability, and braking, the threat of catastrophic tire failure, and drifting while driving on wet or snow-covered roads. Ford allegedly knew or should have known about the defect through pre-release testing data, consumer complaints to Ford dealerships, testing conducted in response to those complaints, aggregate data from Ford’s dealerships, and from other internal sources. Plaintiffs allege Ford had a duty to disclose the defect but failed to do so at the time of sale. Plaintiffs further allege that, had they known about the defect, they would not have purchased the Focus.\nPlaintiffs instituted this putative class action against Ford on November 2, 2011, asserting five claims: (1) violation of California’s Consumers Legal Remedies Act, Cal. Civ.Code §§ 1750-1784; (2) violation of California’s Unfair Competition Law, Cal. Bus. & Prof.Code §§ 17200-17210; (3) breach of implied warranty under California’s Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, Cal. Civ.Code §§ 1790-1795.8; (4) breach of warranty under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 2301-2312; and (5) breach of express warranty under Cal. Com.Code § 2313.\nAfter Plaintiffs moved to certify a class defined as “[a]ll individuals who purchased or leased any 2005 through 2011 Ford Focus vehicle in California and who currently reside in the United States,” Ford moved for summary judgment. First, the district court granted summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ Consumers Legal Remedies Act and Unfair Competition Law claims because the court concluded that Plaintiffs failed to show reliance. Second, the district court granted summary judgment on the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act claims of Plaintiffs Hauser, Glass, and Duarte because the court concluded that they failed to present evidence that their vehicles became unmerchantable within the duration of the implied warranty. Third, , the district court granted summary judgment on the breach of express warranty claims of Plaintiffs Daniel and Duarte because the court concluded that the New Vehicle Limited Warranty did not cover the alleged design defect. Finally, the district court granted summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act claims because those claims depend on Plaintiffs’ warranty claims. The district court also denied Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. In accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), the district court entered final judgment. Plaintiffs timely appealed.\nII. Discussion\nWe have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. “We review orders granting summary judgment de novo.” Clevo Co. v. Hecny Tramp., Inc., 715 F.3d 1189, 1193 (9th Cir.2013). We apply “the same principles as the district court: whether, with the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there are no genuine issues of material fact, so that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Id. (quoting Bamonte v. City of Mesa, 598 F.3d 1217, 1220 (9th Cir.2010)).\nPlaintiffs raise three issues on appeal: (1) whether summary judgment was improper because the district court declined to follow a California appellate court decision that held that “latent defects” may breach the implied warranty even when they are not discovered within the implied warranty’s duration; (2) whether summary judgment was improper because the district court interpreted the language in Ford’s express warranty that specifically references defects “introduced into vehicles during the design ... process[ ]” to exclude design defects; and (3) whether summary judgment was improper because the district court did not credit dealership omission evidence that Plaintiffs submitted to establish reliance. We address each in turn.\nA. Breach of Implied Warranty under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act\nPursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, “every sale of consumer goods that are sold at retail in this state shall be accompanied by the manufacturer’s and the retail seller’s implied warranty that the goods are merchantable.” Cal. Civ.Code § 1792. Pertinent to this appeal, the Act contains a one-year durational limitation:\nThe duration of the implied warranty of merchantability and where present the implied warranty of fitness shall be coextensive in duration with an express warranty which accompanies the consumer goods, provided the duration of the express warranty is reasonable; but in no event shall such implied warranty have a duration of less than 60 days nor more than one year following the sale of new consumer goods to a retail buyer. Where no duration for an express warranty is stated with respect to consumer goods, or parts thereof, the duration of the implied warranty shall be the maximum period prescribed above.\nCal. Civ.Code § 1791.1(c) (emphasis added). ' Yet the California Court of Appeal held in Mexia v. Rinker Boat Co. that “[tjhere is nothing that suggests a requirement that the purchaser discover and report to the seller a latent defect within that time period.” 174 Cal.App.4th 1297, 95 Cal.Rptr.3d 285, 295 (2009) (emphasis added).\n“We ‘must follow the decision of the intermediate appellate courts of the state unless there is convincing evidence that the highest court of the state would decide differently.’ ” In re Schwarzkopf, 626 F.3d 1032, 1038 (9th Cir.2010) (quoting Owen ex. rel Owen v. United States, 713 F.2d 1461, 1464 (9th Cir.1983)). Here, there is not convincing evidence that the California Supreme Court would decide the latent defect discovery issue that was presented in Mexia differently. The California Supreme Court denied the Mexia defendants’ petition for review and denied a non-party’s request for “depublication” of the opinion. See Appellate Courts Case Information, The Judicial Branch of California, http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca. gov/search/case/disposition.cfm?dist=0& doc(l)_id=1914874&doc(l)_no=S174901 (last visited Oct. 28, 2015). No published California Court of Appeal opinion has addressed or rejected the Mexia holding. Two unpublished decisions reiterated the one-year duration set forth in § 1791.1, but neither cited Mexia. Balakian v. Mercedes-Benz USA LLC, No. F060461, 2011 WL 6826723, at *7 n. 8 (Cal.Ct.App. Dec. 29, 2011) (unpublished); Larsen v. Nissan N. Am., Inc., No. A121838, 2009 WL 1766797, at *6 (Cal.Ct.App. June 23, 2009) (unpublished). The two unpublished decisions that have referenced the Mexia rule did so without disapproval. Clark v. BMW of N. Am., LLC, B248593, 2014 WL 3907922, at *6 (Cal.Ct.App. Aug. 12, 2014) (unpublished); Lugo v. Good Guys Auto Sales, Inc., D061620, 2013 WL 5411650, at *7 (Cal.Ct.App. Sept. 27, 2013) (unpublished). While California federal district courts have given Mexia mixed treatment, see, e.g., Valencia v. Volkswagen Grp. of Am. Inc., - F.Supp.3d -, - - -, No. 15-cv-00887-HSG, 2015 WL 4747533, at *6-7 (N.D.Cal. Aug. 11, 2015) (discussing cases on both sides and distinguishing Mexia based on a reading that limits the holding to cases involving products that were unmerchantable at the time of purchase); Rossi v. Whirlpool Corp., No. 12-CV-125-JAM-JFM, 2013 WL 1312105, at *5 (E.D.Cal. Mar. 28, 2013) (rejecting Me-xia); Keegan v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 284 F.R.D. 504, 537 (C.D.Cal.2012) (following Mexia), we must adhere to state court decisions — not federal court decisions — as the authoritative interpretation of state law. W. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 311 U.S. 223, 237-38, 61 S.Ct. 179, 85 L.Ed. 139 (1940).\nFord argues that Mexia conflicts with the earlier decision in Atkinson v. Elk Corp. of Texas, 142 Cal.App.4th 212, 48 Cal.Rptr.3d 247 (2006). But Mexia and Atkinson are not in “plain conflict.” Cf. Owen ex. rel Owen, 713 F.2d at 1465. In Atkinson, the pertinent issue was “what is the duration of implied warranty of merchantability under Magnuson-Moss,” and the court concluded that § 1791.1 controls. 48 Cal.Rptr.3d at 257-59. The precise issue of whether § 1791.1 “create^] a deadline for discovering latent defects,” which was addressed in Mexia, 95 Cal.Rptr.3d at 288, was not at issue in Atkinson. Additionally, the Mexia court relied on Atkinson approvingly without noting any inconsistency, id. at 295 n. 10, and Mexia is consistent with an earlier case, Hicks v. Kaufman & Broad Home Corp., 89 Cal.App.4th 908, 107 Cal.Rptr.2d 761, 768 (2001) (holding that “proof of breach of warranty does not require proof the product has malfunctioned but only that it contains an inherent defect which is substantially certain to result in malfunction during the useful life of the product”). Further, the Mexia decision is in line with “the policy repeatedly expressed by California courts of the need to construe the Song-Beverly Act so as to implement the legislative intent to expand consumer protection and remedies.” Mexia, 95 Cal.Rptr.3d at 296.\nAbsent convincing evidence that the California Supreme Court would decide the issue in Mexia differently, its rule that § 1791.1 “does not create a deadline for discovering latent defects or for giving notice to the seller,” 95 Cal.Rptr.3d at 288, must be followed. Accordingly, the district court’s order granting summary judgment as to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act claims of Plaintiffs Hauser, Glass, and Duarte is reversed.\nB. Breach of Express Warranty under the California Commercial Code\nCalifornia Commercial Code § 2313 governs express warranties by the seller. Ford provided Plaintiffs a New Vehicle Limited Warranty with the purchase of their Focuses.- The express warranty states:\nWHAT IS COVERED?\nYour NEW VEHICLE LIMITED WARRANTY gives you specific legal rights. You may have other rights that vary from state to state. Under your New Vehicle Limited Warranty if:\n—your Ford vehicle is properly operated and maintained, and\n—was taken to a Ford dealership for a warranted repair during the warranty period,\nthen authorized Ford Motor Company dealers will, without charge, repair, replace, or adjust all parts on your vehicle that malfunction or fail during normal use during the applicable coverage period due to a manufacturing defect in factory-supplied materials or factory workmanship.\nThis warranty does not mean that each Ford vehicle is defect free. Defects may be unintentionally introduced into vehicles during the design and manufacturing processes and such defects could result in the need for repairs. For this reason, Ford provides the New Vehicle Limited Warranty in order to remedy any such defects that result in vehicle part malfunction or failure during the warranty period.\nFord relies on the first paragraph to argue that the warranty only guarantees against manufacturing defects. Plaintiffs rely on the second paragraph to argue that the defects that are guaranteed against include design defects.\n“In relation to express warranties, the rules for interpreting them do not differ from those applied to other contracts.” Miller v. Germain Seed & Plant Co., 193 Cal. 62, 222 P. 817, 829 (1924) (Seawell, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). Where a contract provision is “clear and unambiguous,” it is “not subject to questions of construction or interpretation.” Neal v. State Farm Ins. Cos., 188 Cal.App.2d 690, 10 Cal.Rptr. 781, 783 (1961) (internal quotation marks omitted). “A ... provision is ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions, both of which are reasonable.” Producers Dairy Delivery Co. v. Sentry Ins. Co., 41 Cal.3d 903, 226 Cal.Rptr. 558, 718 P.2d 920, 924-25 (1986) (quoting Delgado v. Heritage Life Ins. Co., 157 Cal.App.3d 262, 203 Cal.Rptr. 672, 677 (1984)). “The rule that any ambiguities caused by the draftsman of the contract must be resolved against that party applies with peculiar force in the case of the contract of adhesion.” Neal, 10 Cal.Rptr. at 784 (internal citations omitted). ‘Whether language in a contract is ambiguous is a question of law.” Producers Dairy Delivery Co., 226 Cal.Rptr. 558, 718 P.2d at 925.\nFord argues that the “materials and workmanship” language in the first paragraph excludes guarantees against design defects. See Rice v. Sunbeam Prods., Inc., No. CV 12-7923-CAS-(AJWx), 2013 WL 146270, at *12 (C.D.Cal. Jan. 7, 2013) (considering the phrase “free from defects in material and workmanship” in defendant’s warranty); In re Toyota Motor Corp. Unintended Acceleration Mktg., Sales Practices, & Prods. Liab. Litig. (Toyota Motor Corp. Litig.), 754 F.Supp.2d 1145, 1177-78 (C.D.Cal.2010) (considering defendant’s warranty language that stated, “This warranty covers repairs and adjustments needed to correct defects in material or workmanship of any part supplied by Toyota.”); Brothers v. Hewlett-Packard Co., No. C-06-02254 RMW, 2007 WL 485979, at *2 (N.D.Cal. Feb. 12, 2007) (considering language in defendant’s warranty that stated, “HP warrants that the HP hardware product and all internal components of the product that you have purchased or leased from HP are free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use during the Limited Warranty Period.”).\nHowever, unlike the warranties in the cases cited by Ford, Ford’s express warranty is not simply a “materials and workmanship” warranty, as it references defects that are introduced during the “design” process. Ford’s express warranty is ambiguous. The warranty can reasonably be interpreted to either guarantee against only manufacturing defects (where the second paragraph is a general explanation and not a guarantee) or guarantee against both manufacturing and design defects (where the second paragraph expands the guarantee to design defects). The ambiguity, which is without question within a contract of adhesion, must be resolved against the draftsman, Ford. Neal, 10 Cal.Rptr. at 784. The warranty must be construed to guarantee against both manufacturing, and design defects.\nGiven the ambiguous terms of Ford’s express warranty, the district court’s order granting summary judgment as to the breach of express warranty claims of Plaintiffs Daniel and Duarte is reversed.\nC. Consumers Legal Remedies Act and Unfair Competition Law\nThe Consumers Legal Remedies Act prohibits “unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services.” Cal. Civ.Code § 1770(a). The Act proscribes “[representing that goods or services have ... characteristics ... uses, benefits, or quantities which they do not have,” id. § 1770(a)(5), and “Representing that goods or services are of a particular standard, quality, or grade,” id. § 1770(a)(7). The Unfair Competition Law proscribes “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.” Cal. Bus. & Prof.Code § 17200. Fraudulent omissions are actionable under both consumer statutes. Klein v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 137 Cal.Rptr.3d 293, 324-26 (2012).\nAn essential element for a fraudulent omission claim is actual reliance. Cohen v. DIRECTV, Inc., 178 Cal.App.4th 966, 101 Cal.Rptr.3d 37, 47-48 (2009) (Consumers Legal Remedies Act); In re Tobacco II Cases (Tobacco II), 46 Cal.4th 298, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d 20, 39 (2009) (Unfair Competition Law). ■ To prove reliance on an omission, a plaintiff must show that the defendant’s nondisclosure was an immediate cause of the plaintiffs injury-producing conduct. A plaintiff need not prove that the omission was the only cause or even the predominant cause, only that it was a substantial factor in his decision. Tobacco II, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d at 39. A plaintiff may do so by simply proving “that, had the omitted information been disclosed, one would have been aware of it and behaved differently.” Mirkin v. Wasserman, 5 Cal.4th 1082, 23 Cal.Rptr.2d 101, 858 P.2d 568, 574 (1993).\nThat one would have behaved differently can be presumed, or at least inferred, when the omission is material. Tobacco II, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d at 39. An omission is material if a reasonable consumer “would attach importance to its existence or nonexistence in determining his choice of action in the transaction in question.” Id. (quoting Engalla v. Permanente Med. Grp., Inc., 15 Cal.4th 951, 64 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 938 P.2d 903, 919 (1997)). Alleged defects that create “unreasonable safety risks” are considered material. See Ehrlich v. BMW of N. Am., LLC, 801 F.Supp.2d 908, 917-19 (C.D.Cal.2010) (windshield with high propensity to crack or chip); Falk v. Gen. Motors Corp., 496 F.Supp.2d 1088, 1095-96, 1096 n. * (N.D.Cal.2007) (defective speedometer); see also Wilson v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 668 F.3d 1136, 1141-43 (9th Cir.2012) (holding in the duty-to-disclose context that an omission must pose safety concerns to be material). Materiality is judged from the perspective of a “reasonable consumer,” Ehrlich, 801 F.Supp.2d at 916, and it is generally a question of fact, Tobacco II, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d at 39.\nHere, Plaintiffs have offered sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to the second sub-element of reliance — whether they would have behaved differently if Ford had disclosed the alleged defect. A reasonable fact finder could infer that a vehicle that experiences premature and more frequent tire wear would pose an unreasonable safety risk, such that it can be presumed that the nondisclosure of the safety risk impacted Plaintiffs’ purchasing decision. Plaintiffs have put forth sufficient evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to them, that the Focus experienced premature and more frequent tire wear, and that Ford circulated special service messages to its authorized dealerships informing them that “some 2005-2011 Focus vehicles may exhibit premature front/rear tire wear and/or a vehicle drift condition when driving on wet or snow packed roads.” Plaintiffs’ experts opined that worn tires can pose a safety hazard in terms of road and weather conditions and potential blowouts. Even Ford acknowledges that “it can be dangerous to let the tires on any vehicle become excessively worn before replacing them.” Brief for Appellee at 25. Ford’s evidence that routine monitoring of the tires would have prevented safety problems and that excessive tire wear is not uniquely attributable to the Focus does not conclusively rebut the presumption of reliance. See Engalla, 64 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 938 P.2d at 919.\nWhether Plaintiffs have created a genuine issue of material fact as to the first sub-element — that they would have been aware of a disclosure by Ford — is a closer question, but we ultimately conclude that they did, There are, of course, various ways in which a plaintiff can demonstrate that she would have been aware of a defect, had disclosure been made. Here, Plaintiffs chose to do so by showing that they would have been aware of the defect had Ford disclosed it to its dealerships. Ford presented evidence that conclusively establishes that Plaintiffs did not view any advertising materials produced by Ford prior to purchase. But Plaintiffs presented evidence that they interacted with and received information from sales representatives at authorized Ford dealerships pri- or to purchasing their Focuses. This is sufficient to sustain a factual finding that Plaintiffs would have been aware of the disclosure if it had been made through Ford’s authorized dealerships. Mirkin, 23 Cal.Rptr.2d 101, 858 P.2d at 575.\nFord argues that Plaintiffs need to show more than that it was hypothetically possible for Ford to disseminate information through its dealerships. Ford suggests that Plaintiffs should be required to show that the dealerships were contractually obligated to pass on disclosures to consumers or that dealerships would voluntarily do so. Plaintiffs do not have such evidence. However, Plaintiffs do have evidence that Ford communicates indirectly through its authorized dealerships. Plaintiffs received information about the “characteristics,” “benefits,” and “quality,” Cal. Civ.Code § 1770(a)(5), (7), of the Ford Focus from Ford’s dealerships, which is also where they could obtain certain brochures and booklets about Ford’s vehicles. Under the terms of Ford’s express warranty, Plaintiffs needed to return to Ford dealerships to perform warranty repairs. And it is through its dealership network that Ford circulated its special service messages and technical service bulletins when issues arose with the Focus. Based on this evidence, a reasonable fact finder could conclude that Ford knew that its consumers depended at least in part on its authorized dealerships for information about its vehicles and that Ford’s authorized dealerships would have disclosed the alleged rear suspension defect to consumers if Ford had required it. Since Plaintiffs have sufficient evidence to establish a plausible method of disclosure and to establish that they would have been aware of information disclosed using that method, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether they in fact relied on Ford’s omissions in purchasing the Focus.\nBecause Plaintiffs have raised a genuine issue of fact as to reliance, the district court’s order granting summary judgment on their Consumers Legal Remedies Act and Unfair Competition Law claims is reversed.\nD. Additional Issues Raised by Ford\nBecause the district court did not address duty to disclose, actual damages, statutorily-required notice, statute of limitations, equitable restitution, and sufficiency of the evidence of tire wear, we decline to do so on appeal. Petersen v. Boeing Co., 715 F.3d 276, 283 (9th Cir.2013) (declining to reach the “alternate, fact-intensive bases for affirming” when not first addressed by the district court).\nE. Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act\nClaims under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act “stand or fall with ... express and implied warranty claims under state law.” Clemens v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 534 F.3d 1017, 1022 (9th Cir.2008). Because we reverse on Plaintiffs’ implied and express warranty claims, the district court order granting summary judgment as to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act claims is also reversed.\nIII. Conclusion\nWe reverse the district court’s summary judgment order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In light of our reversal, we also instruct the district court to reconsider its denial of Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.\nREVERSED and REMANDED with instruction.\n. The English colloquialisms such as \""turn out to be a pig in a poke” or \""buy a pig in a poke” mean that something is sold or bought without the buyer knowing its true nature or value, especially when buying without inspecting the item beforehand.\n. A fifth plaintiff, Robert McCabe, withdrew as a named plaintiff, and Plaintiffs are not pursuing his claims.\n. \""Even though unpublished California Courts of Appeal decisions have no prece-dential value under California law, the Ninth Circuit is 'not precluded' from considering such decisions ‘as a possible reflection of California law.’ ” Roberts v. McAfee, Inc., 660 F.3d 1156, 1167 n. 6 (9th Cir.2011) (quoting Emp’rs Ins. of Wausau v. Granite State Ins. Co., 330 F.3d 1214, 1220 n. 8 (9th Cir.2003)).\n. The district court denied summary judgment as to Plaintiff Daniel’s Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act claim.\n. Plaintiff Hauser did not oppose summary judgment on her express warranty claim, and Plaintiff Glass does not challenge the district court's ruling on appeal.\n. It would have been unlikely for Plaintiffs to review warranty, maintenance, and owner’s booklets that came with the new vehicles pri- or to purchase. Consequently, those materials cannot be considered in determining whether Plaintiffs would have been aware of a disclosure. Cf. Moore v. Apple, Inc., 73 F.Supp.3d 1191, 1200-01 (N.D.Cal.2014) (concluding reliance cannot be based on representations or omissions that took place after sale occurred); In re Sony Gaming Networks & Customer Data Sec. Breach Litig., 903 F.Supp.2d 942, 969-70 (S.D.Cal.2012) (concluding it was impossible to establish reliance on information in Terms of Service received after purchase)."",""type"":""majority""}],""judges"":[""Before: STEPHEN REINHARDT and MICHAEL DALY HAWKINS, Circuit Judges and DONALD W.

The answer to that question is complicated by a dispute over the interpretation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act by the California Court of Appeal and whether that court’s decision is binding on federal courts in diversity cases. If it is, the consequence negatively impacts the trial court’s determination of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act in this case. There is also a concern about the warranties, focused on whether the language written by Ford is ambiguous. Finally, there is the question of whether the record here can be construed to show reliance in favor of the plaintiffs when they admittedly did not read available materials about the Ford Focus. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Ford. We reverse.\nI. Background\nThe plaintiffs, Margie Daniel, Mary Hauser, Donna Glass, and Andrea Duarte (collectively “Plaintiffs”), brought this class action against Ford, alleging that Ford breached implied and express warranties and committed fraud in the sale of model year 2005 to 2011 Ford Focus vehicles containing rear suspension defects. Plaintiffs purchased their Ford Focus vehicles from authorized Ford dealerships in California. With each purchase, Plaintiffs received a New Vehicle Limited Warranty. Prior to purchase, they did not research the Focus or view brochures, websites, or advertisements about the Focus. Nor did they read the warranty, maintenance, or owner’s guides that came with the new vehicles prior to purchasing them. However, Plaintiffs did speak to authorized Ford dealership sales representatives about the Focus when they made their purchases. After purchase, Plaintiffs’ Focuses required new rear tires for the first time between 12,086 and 20,723 miles.\nPlaintiffs allege that the Focus has a rear suspension “alignment/geometry” defect that leads to premature tire wear, which in turn leads to safety hazards such as decreased control in handling, steering, stability, and braking, the threat of catastrophic tire failure, and drifting while driving on wet or snow-covered roads. Ford allegedly knew or should have known about the defect through pre-release testing data, consumer complaints to Ford dealerships, testing conducted in response to those complaints, aggregate data from Ford’s dealerships, and from other internal sources. Plaintiffs allege Ford had a duty to disclose the defect but failed to do so at the time of sale. Plaintiffs further allege that, had they known about the defect, they would not have purchased the Focus.\nPlaintiffs instituted this putative class action against Ford on November 2, 2011, asserting five claims: (1) violation of California’s Consumers Legal Remedies Act, Cal. Civ.Code §§ 1750-1784; (2) violation of California’s Unfair Competition Law, Cal. Bus. & Prof.Code §§ 17200-17210; (3) breach of implied warranty under California’s Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, Cal. Civ.Code §§ 1790-1795.8; (4) breach of warranty under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 2301-2312; and (5) breach of express warranty under Cal. Com.Code § 2313.\nAfter Plaintiffs moved to certify a class defined as “[a]ll individuals who purchased or leased any 2005 through 2011 Ford Focus vehicle in California and who currently reside in the United States,” Ford moved for summary judgment. First, the district court granted summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ Consumers Legal Remedies Act and Unfair Competition Law claims because the court concluded that Plaintiffs failed to show reliance. Second, the district court granted summary judgment on the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act claims of Plaintiffs Hauser, Glass, and Duarte because the court concluded that they failed to present evidence that their vehicles became unmerchantable within the duration of the implied warranty. Third, , the district court granted summary judgment on the breach of express warranty claims of Plaintiffs Daniel and Duarte because the court concluded that the New Vehicle Limited Warranty did not cover the alleged design defect. Finally, the district court granted summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act claims because those claims depend on Plaintiffs’ warranty claims. The district court also denied Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. In accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), the district court entered final judgment. Plaintiffs timely appealed.\nII. Discussion\nWe have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. “We review orders granting summary judgment de novo.” Clevo Co. v. Hecny Tramp., Inc., 715 F.3d 1189, 1193 (9th Cir.2013). We apply “the same principles as the district court: whether, with the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there are no genuine issues of material fact, so that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Id. (quoting Bamonte v. City of Mesa, 598 F.3d 1217, 1220 (9th Cir.2010)).\nPlaintiffs raise three issues on appeal: (1) whether summary judgment was improper because the district court declined to follow a California appellate court decision that held that “latent defects” may breach the implied warranty even when they are not discovered within the implied warranty’s duration; (2) whether summary judgment was improper because the district court interpreted the language in Ford’s express warranty that specifically references defects “introduced into vehicles during the design ... process[ ]” to exclude design defects; and (3) whether summary judgment was improper because the district court did not credit dealership omission evidence that Plaintiffs submitted to establish reliance. We address each in turn.\nA. Breach of Implied Warranty under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act\nPursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, “every sale of consumer goods that are sold at retail in this state shall be accompanied by the manufacturer’s and the retail seller’s implied warranty that the goods are merchantable.” Cal. Civ.Code § 1792. Pertinent to this appeal, the Act contains a one-year durational limitation:\nThe duration of the implied warranty of merchantability and where present the implied warranty of fitness shall be coextensive in duration with an express warranty which accompanies the consumer goods, provided the duration of the express warranty is reasonable; but in no event shall such implied warranty have a duration of less than 60 days nor more than one year following the sale of new consumer goods to a retail buyer. Where no duration for an express warranty is stated with respect to consumer goods, or parts thereof, the duration of the implied warranty shall be the maximum period prescribed above.\nCal. Civ.Code § 1791.1(c) (emphasis added). \' Yet the California Court of Appeal held in Mexia v. Rinker Boat Co. that “[tjhere is nothing that suggests a requirement that the purchaser discover and report to the seller a latent defect within that time period.” 174 Cal.App.4th 1297, 95 Cal.Rptr.3d 285, 295 (2009) (emphasis added).\n“We ‘must follow the decision of the intermediate appellate courts of the state unless there is convincing evidence that the highest court of the state would decide differently.’ ” In re Schwarzkopf, 626 F.3d 1032, 1038 (9th Cir.2010) (quoting Owen ex. rel Owen v. United States, 713 F.2d 1461, 1464 (9th Cir.1983)). Here, there is not convincing evidence that the California Supreme Court would decide the latent defect discovery issue that was presented in Mexia differently. The California Supreme Court denied the Mexia defendants’ petition for review and denied a non-party’s request for “depublication” of the opinion. See Appellate Courts Case Information, The Judicial Branch of California, http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca. gov/search/case/disposition.cfm?dist=0& doc(l)_id=1914874&doc(l)_no=S174901 (last visited Oct. 28, 2015). No published California Court of Appeal opinion has addressed or rejected the Mexia holding. Two unpublished decisions reiterated the one-year duration set forth in § 1791.1, but neither cited Mexia. Balakian v. Mercedes-Benz USA LLC, No. F060461, 2011 WL 6826723, at *7 n. 8 (Cal.Ct.App. Dec. 29, 2011) (unpublished); Larsen v. Nissan N. Am., Inc., No. A121838, 2009 WL 1766797, at *6 (Cal.Ct.App. June 23, 2009) (unpublished). The two unpublished decisions that have referenced the Mexia rule did so without disapproval. Clark v. BMW of N. Am., LLC, B248593, 2014 WL 3907922, at *6 (Cal.Ct.App. Aug. 12, 2014) (unpublished); Lugo v. Good Guys Auto Sales, Inc., D061620, 2013 WL 5411650, at *7 (Cal.Ct.App. Sept. 27, 2013) (unpublished). While California federal district courts have given Mexia mixed treatment, see, e.g., Valencia v. Volkswagen Grp. of Am. Inc., - F.Supp.3d -, - - -, No. 15-cv-00887-HSG, 2015 WL 4747533, at *6-7 (N.D.Cal. Aug. 11, 2015) (discussing cases on both sides and distinguishing Mexia based on a reading that limits the holding to cases involving products that were unmerchantable at the time of purchase); Rossi v. Whirlpool Corp., No. 12-CV-125-JAM-JFM, 2013 WL 1312105, at *5 (E.D.Cal. Mar. 28, 2013) (rejecting Me-xia); Keegan v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 284 F.R.D. 504, 537 (C.D.Cal.2012) (following Mexia), we must adhere to state court decisions — not federal court decisions — as the authoritative interpretation of state law. W. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 311 U.S. 223, 237-38, 61 S.Ct. 179, 85 L.Ed. 139 (1940).\nFord argues that Mexia conflicts with the earlier decision in Atkinson v. Elk Corp. of Texas, 142 Cal.App.4th 212, 48 Cal.Rptr.3d 247 (2006). But Mexia and Atkinson are not in “plain conflict.” Cf. Owen ex. rel Owen, 713 F.2d at 1465. In Atkinson, the pertinent issue was “what is the duration of implied warranty of merchantability under Magnuson-Moss,” and the court concluded that § 1791.1 controls. 48 Cal.Rptr.3d at 257-59. The precise issue of whether § 1791.1 “create^] a deadline for discovering latent defects,” which was addressed in Mexia, 95 Cal.Rptr.3d at 288, was not at issue in Atkinson. Additionally, the Mexia court relied on Atkinson approvingly without noting any inconsistency, id. at 295 n. 10, and Mexia is consistent with an earlier case, Hicks v. Kaufman & Broad Home Corp., 89 Cal.App.4th 908, 107 Cal.Rptr.2d 761, 768 (2001) (holding that “proof of breach of warranty does not require proof the product has malfunctioned but only that it contains an inherent defect which is substantially certain to result in malfunction during the useful life of the product”). Further, the Mexia decision is in line with “the policy repeatedly expressed by California courts of the need to construe the Song-Beverly Act so as to implement the legislative intent to expand consumer protection and remedies.” Mexia, 95 Cal.Rptr.3d at 296.\nAbsent convincing evidence that the California Supreme Court would decide the issue in Mexia differently, its rule that § 1791.1 “does not create a deadline for discovering latent defects or for giving notice to the seller,” 95 Cal.Rptr.3d at 288, must be followed. Accordingly, the district court’s order granting summary judgment as to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act claims of Plaintiffs Hauser, Glass, and Duarte is reversed.\nB. Breach of Express Warranty under the California Commercial Code\nCalifornia Commercial Code § 2313 governs express warranties by the seller. Ford provided Plaintiffs a New Vehicle Limited Warranty with the purchase of their Focuses.- The express warranty states:\nWHAT IS COVERED?\nYour NEW VEHICLE LIMITED WARRANTY gives you specific legal rights. You may have other rights that vary from state to state. Under your New Vehicle Limited Warranty if:\n—your Ford vehicle is properly operated and maintained, and\n—was taken to a Ford dealership for a warranted repair during the warranty period,\nthen authorized Ford Motor Company dealers will, without charge, repair, replace, or adjust all parts on your vehicle that malfunction or fail during normal use during the applicable coverage period due to a manufacturing defect in factory-supplied materials or factory workmanship.\nThis warranty does not mean that each Ford vehicle is defect free. Defects may be unintentionally introduced into vehicles during the design and manufacturing processes and such defects could result in the need for repairs. For this reason, Ford provides the New Vehicle Limited Warranty in order to remedy any such defects that result in vehicle part malfunction or failure during the warranty period.\nFord relies on the first paragraph to argue that the warranty only guarantees against manufacturing defects. Plaintiffs rely on the second paragraph to argue that the defects that are guaranteed against include design defects.\n“In relation to express warranties, the rules for interpreting them do not differ from those applied to other contracts.” Miller v. Germain Seed & Plant Co., 193 Cal. 62, 222 P. 817, 829 (1924) (Seawell, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). Where a contract provision is “clear and unambiguous,” it is “not subject to questions of construction or interpretation.” Neal v. State Farm Ins. Cos., 188 Cal.App.2d 690, 10 Cal.Rptr. 781, 783 (1961) (internal quotation marks omitted). “A ... provision is ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions, both of which are reasonable.” Producers Dairy Delivery Co. v. Sentry Ins. Co., 41 Cal.3d 903, 226 Cal.Rptr. 558, 718 P.2d 920, 924-25 (1986) (quoting Delgado v. Heritage Life Ins. Co., 157 Cal.App.3d 262, 203 Cal.Rptr. 672, 677 (1984)). “The rule that any ambiguities caused by the draftsman of the contract must be resolved against that party applies with peculiar force in the case of the contract of adhesion.” Neal, 10 Cal.Rptr. at 784 (internal citations omitted). ‘Whether language in a contract is ambiguous is a question of law.” Producers Dairy Delivery Co., 226 Cal.Rptr. 558, 718 P.2d at 925.\nFord argues that the “materials and workmanship” language in the first paragraph excludes guarantees against design defects. See Rice v. Sunbeam Prods., Inc., No. CV 12-7923-CAS-(AJWx), 2013 WL 146270, at *12 (C.D.Cal. Jan. 7, 2013) (considering the phrase “free from defects in material and workmanship” in defendant’s warranty); In re Toyota Motor Corp. Unintended Acceleration Mktg., Sales Practices, & Prods. Liab. Litig. (Toyota Motor Corp. Litig.), 754 F.Supp.2d 1145, 1177-78 (C.D.Cal.2010) (considering defendant’s warranty language that stated, “This warranty covers repairs and adjustments needed to correct defects in material or workmanship of any part supplied by Toyota.”); Brothers v. Hewlett-Packard Co., No. C-06-02254 RMW, 2007 WL 485979, at *2 (N.D.Cal. Feb. 12, 2007) (considering language in defendant’s warranty that stated, “HP warrants that the HP hardware product and all internal components of the product that you have purchased or leased from HP are free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use during the Limited Warranty Period.”).\nHowever, unlike the warranties in the cases cited by Ford, Ford’s express warranty is not simply a “materials and workmanship” warranty, as it references defects that are introduced during the “design” process. Ford’s express warranty is ambiguous. The warranty can reasonably be interpreted to either guarantee against only manufacturing defects (where the second paragraph is a general explanation and not a guarantee) or guarantee against both manufacturing and design defects (where the second paragraph expands the guarantee to design defects). The ambiguity, which is without question within a contract of adhesion, must be resolved against the draftsman, Ford. Neal, 10 Cal.Rptr. at 784. The warranty must be construed to guarantee against both manufacturing, and design defects.\nGiven the ambiguous terms of Ford’s express warranty, the district court’s order granting summary judgment as to the breach of express warranty claims of Plaintiffs Daniel and Duarte is reversed.\nC. Consumers Legal Remedies Act and Unfair Competition Law\nThe Consumers Legal Remedies Act prohibits “unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services.” Cal. Civ.Code § 1770(a). The Act proscribes “[representing that goods or services have ... characteristics ... uses, benefits, or quantities which they do not have,” id. § 1770(a)(5), and “Representing that goods or services are of a particular standard, quality, or grade,” id. § 1770(a)(7). The Unfair Competition Law proscribes “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.” Cal. Bus. & Prof.Code § 17200. Fraudulent omissions are actionable under both consumer statutes. Klein v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 137 Cal.Rptr.3d 293, 324-26 (2012).\nAn essential element for a fraudulent omission claim is actual reliance. Cohen v. DIRECTV, Inc., 178 Cal.App.4th 966, 101 Cal.Rptr.3d 37, 47-48 (2009) (Consumers Legal Remedies Act); In re Tobacco II Cases (Tobacco II), 46 Cal.4th 298, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d 20, 39 (2009) (Unfair Competition Law). ■ To prove reliance on an omission, a plaintiff must show that the defendant’s nondisclosure was an immediate cause of the plaintiffs injury-producing conduct. A plaintiff need not prove that the omission was the only cause or even the predominant cause, only that it was a substantial factor in his decision. Tobacco II, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d at 39. A plaintiff may do so by simply proving “that, had the omitted information been disclosed, one would have been aware of it and behaved differently.” Mirkin v. Wasserman, 5 Cal.4th 1082, 23 Cal.Rptr.2d 101, 858 P.2d 568, 574 (1993).\nThat one would have behaved differently can be presumed, or at least inferred, when the omission is material. Tobacco II, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d at 39. An omission is material if a reasonable consumer “would attach importance to its existence or nonexistence in determining his choice of action in the transaction in question.” Id. (quoting Engalla v. Permanente Med. Grp., Inc., 15 Cal.4th 951, 64 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 938 P.2d 903, 919 (1997)). Alleged defects that create “unreasonable safety risks” are considered material. See Ehrlich v. BMW of N. Am., LLC, 801 F.Supp.2d 908, 917-19 (C.D.Cal.2010) (windshield with high propensity to crack or chip); Falk v. Gen. Motors Corp., 496 F.Supp.2d 1088, 1095-96, 1096 n. * (N.D.Cal.2007) (defective speedometer); see also Wilson v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 668 F.3d 1136, 1141-43 (9th Cir.2012) (holding in the duty-to-disclose context that an omission must pose safety concerns to be material). Materiality is judged from the perspective of a “reasonable consumer,” Ehrlich, 801 F.Supp.2d at 916, and it is generally a question of fact, Tobacco II, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d at 39.\nHere, Plaintiffs have offered sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to the second sub-element of reliance — whether they would have behaved differently if Ford had disclosed the alleged defect. A reasonable fact finder could infer that a vehicle that experiences premature and more frequent tire wear would pose an unreasonable safety risk, such that it can be presumed that the nondisclosure of the safety risk impacted Plaintiffs’ purchasing decision. Plaintiffs have put forth sufficient evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to them, that the Focus experienced premature and more frequent tire wear, and that Ford circulated special service messages to its authorized dealerships informing them that “some 2005-2011 Focus vehicles may exhibit premature front/rear tire wear and/or a vehicle drift condition when driving on wet or snow packed roads.” Plaintiffs’ experts opined that worn tires can pose a safety hazard in terms of road and weather conditions and potential blowouts. Even Ford acknowledges that “it can be dangerous to let the tires on any vehicle become excessively worn before replacing them.” Brief for Appellee at 25. Ford’s evidence that routine monitoring of the tires would have prevented safety problems and that excessive tire wear is not uniquely attributable to the Focus does not conclusively rebut the presumption of reliance. See Engalla, 64 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 938 P.2d at 919.\nWhether Plaintiffs have created a genuine issue of material fact as to the first sub-element — that they would have been aware of a disclosure by Ford — is a closer question, but we ultimately conclude that they did, There are, of course, various ways in which a plaintiff can demonstrate that she would have been aware of a defect, had disclosure been made. Here, Plaintiffs chose to do so by showing that they would have been aware of the defect had Ford disclosed it to its dealerships. Ford presented evidence that conclusively establishes that Plaintiffs did not view any advertising materials produced by Ford prior to purchase. But Plaintiffs presented evidence that they interacted with and received information from sales representatives at authorized Ford dealerships pri- or to purchasing their Focuses. This is sufficient to sustain a factual finding that Plaintiffs would have been aware of the disclosure if it had been made through Ford’s authorized dealerships. Mirkin, 23 Cal.Rptr.2d 101, 858 P.2d at 575.\nFord argues that Plaintiffs need to show more than that it was hypothetically possible for Ford to disseminate information through its dealerships. Ford suggests that Plaintiffs should be required to show that the dealerships were contractually obligated to pass on disclosures to consumers or that dealerships would voluntarily do so. Plaintiffs do not have such evidence. However, Plaintiffs do have evidence that Ford communicates indirectly through its authorized dealerships. Plaintiffs received information about the “characteristics,” “benefits,” and “quality,” Cal. Civ.Code § 1770(a)(5), (7), of the Ford Focus from Ford’s dealerships, which is also where they could obtain certain brochures and booklets about Ford’s vehicles. Under the terms of Ford’s express warranty, Plaintiffs needed to return to Ford dealerships to perform warranty repairs. And it is through its dealership network that Ford circulated its special service messages and technical service bulletins when issues arose with the Focus. Based on this evidence, a reasonable fact finder could conclude that Ford knew that its consumers depended at least in part on its authorized dealerships for information about its vehicles and that Ford’s authorized dealerships would have disclosed the alleged rear suspension defect to consumers if Ford had required it. Since Plaintiffs have sufficient evidence to establish a plausible method of disclosure and to establish that they would have been aware of information disclosed using that method, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether they in fact relied on Ford’s omissions in purchasing the Focus.\nBecause Plaintiffs have raised a genuine issue of fact as to reliance, the district court’s order granting summary judgment on their Consumers Legal Remedies Act and Unfair Competition Law claims is reversed.\nD. Additional Issues Raised by Ford\nBecause the district court did not address duty to disclose, actual damages, statutorily-required notice, statute of limitations, equitable restitution, and sufficiency of the evidence of tire wear, we decline to do so on appeal. Petersen v. Boeing Co., 715 F.3d 276, 283 (9th Cir.2013) (declining to reach the “alternate, fact-intensive bases for affirming” when not first addressed by the district court).\nE. Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act\nClaims under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act “stand or fall with ... express and implied warranty claims under state law.” Clemens v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 534 F.3d 1017, 1022 (9th Cir.2008). Because we reverse on Plaintiffs’ implied and express warranty claims, the district court order granting summary judgment as to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act claims is also reversed.\nIII. Conclusion\nWe reverse the district court’s summary judgment order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In light of our reversal, we also instruct the district court to reconsider its denial of Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.\nREVERSED and REMANDED with instruction.\n. The English colloquialisms such as ""turn out to be a pig in a poke” or ""buy a pig in a poke” mean that something is sold or bought without the buyer knowing its true nature or value, especially when buying without inspecting the item beforehand.\n. A fifth plaintiff, Robert McCabe, withdrew as a named plaintiff, and Plaintiffs are not pursuing his claims.\n. ""Even though unpublished California Courts of Appeal decisions have no prece-dential value under California law, the Ninth Circuit is \'not precluded\' from considering such decisions ‘as a possible reflection of California law.’ ” Roberts v. McAfee, Inc., 660 F.3d 1156, 1167 n. 6 (9th Cir.2011) (quoting Emp’rs Ins. of Wausau v. Granite State Ins. Co., 330 F.3d 1214, 1220 n. 8 (9th Cir.2003)).\n. The district court denied summary judgment as to Plaintiff Daniel’s Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act claim.\n. Plaintiff Hauser did not oppose summary judgment on her express warranty claim, and Plaintiff Glass does not challenge the district court\'s ruling on appeal.\n. It would have been unlikely for Plaintiffs to review warranty, maintenance, and owner’s booklets that came with the new vehicles pri- or to purchase. Consequently, those materials cannot be considered in determining whether Plaintiffs would have been aware of a disclosure. Cf. Moore v. Apple, Inc., 73 F.Supp.3d 1191, 1200-01 (N.D.Cal.2014) (concluding reliance cannot be based on representations or omissions that took place after sale occurred); In re Sony Gaming Networks & Customer Data Sec. Breach Litig., 903 F.Supp.2d 942, 969-70 (S.D.Cal.2012) (concluding it was impossible to establish reliance on information in Terms of Service received after purchase).', 'type': 'majority'}]"

(“the Debtor” or “UMI”) was one (1) of more than seventy (70) entities in a vertically integrated business (“the Universal Network”). The Universal Network operated approximately thirty-six (36) gas stations in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and also distributed gasoline to unaffiliated gas stations.\nOn July 23, 2009, UMI commenced this chapter 11 bankruptcy case. UMI was the only Universal Network entity that filed a bankruptcy petition. The reorganization phase of the case was sbort-lived; the case was converted to chapter 7 on August 18, 2009.\nEight (8) months after the conversion of the case, on April 19, 2010, Charles R. Goldstein, the chapter 7 trustee (“the Trustee”) filed a motion seeking substantive consolidation of UMI’s estate with the estates of certain other Universal Network entities, including Universal Delaware, Inc. (“UDI”). Wilmington Savings Fund Society (“WSFS”), a bank that provided both commercial credit and cash management 'services to UDI, contested the Trustee’s motion for substantive consolidation.\nOn August 4, 2010, with the consent of all parties, the court entered an order resolving the substantive consolidation issue. The August 4, 2010 Order largely granted the substantive consolidation relief sought by the Trustee. However, the substantive consolidation order excepted WSFS from certain aspects of the Order, in ways to be discussed in more detail below.\nHi ❖ % H* H<\nIn this adversary proceeding, the Trustee seeks to recover money from WSFS based on a variety of claims which may be grouped into three (3) legal cátegories.\nFirst, the Trustee raises what the parties have referred to as “common law” claims, seeking to impose liability for breach of contract. The Trustee asserts that a “post no debits” policy WSFS implemented as to UDI’s bank accounts for a few days in July 2009 breached the UDI-WSFS contract and triggered a “chain-reaction liquidity crisis” throughout the entire Universal Network that “single-handedly sentenced [the] Universal [Network] ... to [its] financial death.”\nSecond, based largely on the same events giving rise to his common law claims, the Trustee asserts a statutory claim under 6 Del. C. § 4A.\nThird, the Trustee asserts traditional bankruptcy transfer avoidance legal theories (preference, fraudulent transfers) under 11 U.S.C. §§ 544, 547, 548, 550, 553(b),. analysis of which is more complex due to the substantive consolidation issues also present in the proceeding.\nIn response, WSFS maintains that the Trustee’s common law claims are based on a gross exaggeration or mischaracterization of the undisputed facts. WSFS contends, quite simply, that it did nothing more than exercise ordinary and proper, garden-variety contractual remedies against UDI after UDI breached its contractual duties to WSFS in various ways (including fraudulently inducing WSFS to enter into the banking and lending relationship with UDI in the first place). WSFS also asserts that no avoidable transfers occurred.\nH* Hí ^ Hs H*\nPresently before the court are the parties’ cross-motions for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability.\nAs explained in Part IX.B., infra, all of the claims at issue are either (1) non-core claims, which require transmission of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court absent consent of the parties, see 28 U.S.C. § 157(c)(1), or (2) core claims, for which the bankruptcy court lacks constitutional authority to enter a final judgment (again, absent consent of the parties), see Stern v. Marshall, — U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2594, 180 L.Ed.2d 475 (2011). In both its Answer to the Second Amended Complaint and its main brief on summary judgment, WSFS unequivocally declined to consent to the entry of a final judgment by the bankruptcy court. Cf. Wellness Int’l Network, Ltd. v. Sharif, — U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1932, 191 L.Ed.2d 911 (2015) (parties may consent to entry of judgment by bankruptcy court). Therefore, I cannot enter a final judgment for either party in this adversary proceeding.\nFor the reasons stated below, I conclude that WSFS is entitled to summary judgment on all but one (1) of the Trustee’s claims, there being one (1) claim in which there are disputed issues of material fact, and that the Trustee is not entitled to summary judgment on any of his claims. In light of the court’s constitutional inability to enter a final order, I will enter an order that dismisses the Trustee’s claims (save one) for purposes of trial of this adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court. At the conclusion of the proceedings in this court, I will issue a comprehensive Report and- Recommendation to the district court for the entry of an appropriate order with respect to all claims as to which the bankruptcy court lacks authority to enter a final judgment.\nII. FACTS\nA. General Structure of the Universal Network\nThe Universal Network was a vertically integrated business involved in the purchase of gasoline and its resale to both Universal entities and to unrelated, third-party businesses. Generally, each of the Universal Network gas stations was owned or leased by a single purpose entity (“SPE”). Within the Universal Network, UMI served as the entity that purchased gasoline from major oil companies and then resold the gasoline to the SPE’s and the unrelated third parties. UDI, acted as the management company for UMI and the SPE’s. Daniel Singh (f/k/a Daminder Batra) (“Singh”) was the principal of UDI and many, if not all, of the other Universal Network entities.\nIn 2009, UMI and UDI each had separate banking relationships — UMI with TD Bank and UDI with WSFS. Other Universal Network entities had banking relationships with other institutions, such as Wa-chovia Bank, Citizens Bank, The Bancorp Bank and PNC Bank, N.A.\nThe cash needs of the various entities were met by numerous inter-company money transfers, often in the magnitude of hundreds of thousands of dollars on a daily basis.\nBy July 2009, the banking relationships that UMI and UDI had with TD Bank and WSFS, respectively, soured. That month, within a few days of each other, TD Bank locked down UMI’s bank accounts and WSFS took similar action against UDI (restricting temporarily, in a manner described in more detail below, outgoing transfers from UDI’s accounts).\nThe dispute before me centers on UDI’s and WSFS’ lending and cash management relationships.\nB. The Formation of the UDI-WSFS Relationship\n■UDI and WSFS first connected in November 2008, when Singh inquired about WSFS’ loan and banking services. (Ex. W-29, WSFS 02026). Following several meetings between Singh and various WSFS representatives, WSFS made a presentation to Singh for cash management services. (Ex. W-30, WSFS 02019). In exchange, Singh provided the “company’s financials.” (Id.). William Foley (“Foley”), WSFS’ Vice President and Relationship Manager, considered the financial reports “quite strong.” (Id.). Singh ultimately requested a $5 million line of credit.\nOn January 26, 2009, Foley submitted a Credit Memorandum to WSFS’ Senior Loan Committee (“the Credit Memorandum”). (Ex. W-31). The Credit Memorandum sought approval for a $5 million working capital line of credit to be used for UDI’s “general working capital needs,” as well as a credit facility and a cash management offering for the prospect of yielding annual account analysis fees of $134 million. (Ex. W-31, WSFS 00527). The terms included “principal due on demand,” a “blanket UCC on all business assets” and an “unlimited guarantee of Daniel Singh.” (Id.). At that time, WSFS did not require financials for UMI because UDI was creditworthy, had a strong balance sheet and was profitable. (Ex. W-28, Foley 2004 Exam, at 56). Nor did the request involve financing for UMI because WSFS understood UMI had its own separate banking relationship. According to Foley, “It was a separate business.” (Id.).\nIn March 2009, UDI and WSFS executed several agreements to formalize two (2) relationships: (1) a lending relationship, designed to provide UDI with working capital for its business operations; and (2) a banking services relationship, in which WSFS provided a variety of cash management services to UDI.\nC. The Lending Relationship\nOn March 19, 2009, UDI and WSFS entered into a line of credit loan transaction (“the Loan”). The Loan was memorialized by various documents, including a Business Loan Agreement (“BLA”), Promissory Note (“the Note”), Security Agreement, Guaranty (“the Guaranty”), Confession of Judgment, and an Assignment of Leases and Rents. (See Ex. W-14). The Note defined these documents collectively as “the Loan Documents.” (Ex. W-14, WSFS 00276, Note ¶ 3 (hanging paragraph)).\n1. the Business Loan Agreement\nThe BLA obligated WSFS to make available to UDI a commercial line of credit in the principal sum of $5 million. (Ex. W-14, WSFS 0259, BLÁ ¶ 1.1). UDI agreed to repay the Loan which was evidenced by the Note. (Id. ¶ 1.2).\nThe BLA includes several representations that UDI made to induce WSFS to extend the Loan. Among those relevant to the pending motions were:\n• There were no actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened which would have a material adverse effect on UDI’s ability to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents. (Id., WSFS 00260, BLA ¶ 3.1(c)).\n• UDI disclosed “in writing all facts that could have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of [UDI] or any collateral for the Loan.” (Id., WSFS 00261, BLA ¶ 3.1(e)).\n• UDI’s and Singh’s financial statements were true' and correct and presented fairly, accurately and completely, the financial position of UDI and Singh. (7d ¶ 3.1(f)).\n• UDI’s assets were held free of other encumbrances and UDI was not obligated to another creditor under a guaranty agreement. (Id. ¶ 3.1(g)).\n• UDI would maintain its primary depository account and cash management relationship with WSFS for the term of the Loan. (Id., WSFS 00264, BLA ¶ 4.1(k)).\n• all representations and warranties of UDI and Singh (as guarantor) were true in all material respects. (Id., WSFS 00260, ¶ 2.2(b)).\nThe BLA enumerated several events of default:\n• Any material false or misleading statement, certificate, representation or warranty by UDI to WSFS. (Id., WSFS 00267, BLA ¶ 5.1(h)).\n• Failure to make timely any payment required under the Loan. (Id., WSFS 00266, BLA ¶ 5.1(a)).\n• Any event of default under the Promissory Note or any of the Loan Documents. (Id. ¶ 5.1(b)).\n• The prospects of the repayment of the Loan becoming materially jeopardized or impaired in the reasonable judgment of WSFS. (Id., WSFS 00267, BLA ¶ 5.1(i)).\n• UDI’s use of the Loan proceeds for something other than the permitted uses. (Id. ¶ 5.1(¿)).\nThe BLA expressly provided that WSFS “shall have no obligation to provide notice of an Event of Default.” (Id. ¶ 5.1 (hanging paragraph)).\nThe BLA provided various remedies to WSFS in the event of a default:\n• acceleration of the balance of the Loan, without any further demand or notice. (Id. ¶ 5.2(a)).\n• increase of the interest rate to an applicable default rate, without notice. (JcL\\ 5.2(b)).\n• any remedy available under applicable law. (Id., SFS 00268, BLA ¶ 5.2(c)).\n2. the Note\nThe Note provided for a $5 million revolving credit facility, with a term commencing on March 19, 2009, with monthly installments of interest on the principal balance, due on the 19th of each month. (Ex. W-14, WSFS 00274-00275, Note Preamble & ¶ 2(b)). The Note provided for its term to end upon demand by WSFS, in its discretion, at any time, and yearly extensions of the facility, the first extension falling on June 30, 2009, just slightly more than three (3) months after the inception of the Loan. (Id. ¶ 2(a)). The Note also required UDI to reduce the principal balance to zero ($0.00) once per year upon request of WSFS, beginning after June 30, 2009, and to maintain a zero balance for thirty (30) days before UDI could once again draw down on the facility. (Id., WSFS 00276, Note ¶ 2(1)).\nParagraph 6 of the Note specified both monetary and non-monetary Events of Default, including:\n• UDI’s failure to make any interest or principal payment' when due (id., WSFS 00278, Note ¶ 6(a), (b));\n• UDI’s failure to maintain its primary deposit account and cash management relationship with WSFS as required by the Loan Agreement (id. ¶ 6(d)); and\n• the occurrence of any other default or Event to Default under the Note or the Loan Documents (id. ¶ 6(e)).\nParagraph 7 of the Note provided certain remedies to WSFS in the Event of Default, including the right to accelerate the Loan without presentation, demand, or protest. (Id. ¶ 7(a)). Like the BLA, the Note imposed no obligation on WSFS to provide notice of an Event of Default. (Id. ¶ 6 (hanging paragraph)). UDI expressly waived any notices (including presentment for payment, dishonor, and protest) under the Note. (Id., WSFS 00279, Note ¶ 9(a)).\n3. the Guaranty\nUnder the Guaranty, Singh served as an absolute and unconditional guarantor of the Loan. Upon default, the Guaranty allowed WSFS to proceed against Singh initially and directly without having to proceed against any other property first. (Id., WSFS 00303, Guaranty Agreement ¶ 2).\nThe Guaranty enumerated several events of default, including:\nif any information contained in any financial statement, application, report, schedule, report, or other document given by [Singh or UDI] in' connection with the Loan ... is not in all material respects true or accurate or if [Singh or UDI] omitted to state any material fact or any fact necessary to make such information not misleading.”\n(7<£¶70>)).\nIn the event of default, the Guaranty granted WSFS the right to accelerate the indebtedness, whether due or not, and required Singh to pay the Loan on demand with immediately available funds. (Id. ¶ 7(hanging paragraph)).\nD. The Banking Relationship (Cash Management Services Agreement)\nOn March 13, 2009, UDI and WSFS entered into a Cash Management Services Agreement (“the CMA”), which required WSFS to provide certain financial services to UDI. (See Ex. W-38). Generally, the relationship provided that WSFS would: maintain multiple deposit accounts for UDI; utilize automatic clearing houses; sweep funds into a single account on an automated basis; and permit the transfer of funds in and out of the accounts via use of the internet.\nThe CMA consisted of several documents for each of the selected services, including “riders.” Certain of these documents will be described in more detail in connection with the Trustee’s contract claim and his statutory claim under 6 Del. C. § 4A. See Parts V.B. and VLB., infra.\nE. The Demise of the UDI-WSFS Relationship\n1. WSFS’ suspicions arise\nIn May 2009, less than two (2) months after formalizing its relationship with UDI, WSFS developed concerns about its new customer. Its suspicions arose after a flurry of Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) activity and a $1 million dollar transfer occurred on May 1, 2009. (Ex. W-19, Foley Dep. at 35-38; Ex. W-20, WSFS 02568). Also, UDI quickly drew down the entire $5 million credit line, necessitating a conversation between Foley and Singh later that month. (Ex. W-28, Foley Dep. at 97). Singh explained the full usage of the line was for capital expenditures. (Id.). This was not an intended use of the line, however, because it was set up for short-term working capital. (Id.).\nThe next month (June 2009), UDI sought to borrow an additional, $2.1 million from WSFS, increasing the credit line to $7.1 million. Foley, as UDI’s customer representative and relationship manager, prepared a credit memo to present UDI’s new request to WSFS’s Loan Committee. (See Ex. W-40). Glenn Kocher, Chair of the Loan Committee and Chief Credit Officer, was uncomfortable with the request. (Ex. W-37, Kocher Dep. at 45). He initially understood UDI to be a “healthy company,” (Id. at 72), but given UDI’s misuse of the credit line at such a rapid pace, he questioned the accuracy of UDI’s initial financial statements. Kocher deferred the request so that Foley could look beyond UDI’s financials to develop a more complete picture of all of Singh’s companies. (Ex. W-37, Kocher Dep. at 45; Ex. W-28, Foley Dep. at 105-7). Accordingly, in conjunction with its additional borrowing request, UDI provided to WSFS certain financial documentation, including a 2007 corporate tax return for UMI and a “review” level financial statement for years-ending December 31, 2006 through December 31, 2008. (Ex. W-28, Foley Dep. at 103, 106-7; Ex. W-44, WSFS 00541).\nBased on its concerns, WSFS did not act on the request for additional credit. It also deferred a decision on extending the existing credit facility under ¶ 2(a) of the Note by pushing out its internal review date for ninety (90) days, from June 30, 2009 to September 30, 2009. (Ex. W-44, WSFS 00541).\n2. WSFS’ discovery of and response to the “Red Notice”\nA dramatic turn of events took place a few weeks later. On the evening of Tuesday, July 14, 2009, WSFS learned that Singh might have another identity. While certain facts are in dispute as to exactly how WSFS became aware of this information, it is clear from the record that WSFS learned that Singh might also be known as “Daminder Batra,” an individual wanted for fraud and money laundering in India. (Ex. W-45, Conway Dep. at 15-16). Upon learning of this possibility, WSFS management searched the internet and viewed an INTERPOL web site where Singh’s face was posted as a “wanted” person. (Id. at 21). The “INTERPOL Notice” listed the “Categories of Offences” as “Counterfeiting/Forgery Conspiracy, Fraud, Fraud Conspiracy,” with the “Arrest Warrant Issued by /India, Allahabad/Indi'a, Mumbai/India,” and instructed in all capitals and bold typeface: “IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION CONTACT YOUR NATIONAL OR LOCAL POLICE.” (Ex. W-46, WSFS 01523). Throughout the litigation, the parties have referred to this notice as “the Red Notice.”\nThe next day (Wednesday, July 15, 2009), the. Red Notice was brought to the attention of WSFS’ security department. Foley confirmed to the security department that the face of “Batra” on the Red Notice was Singh. (Ex. W-19, Foley Dep. at 42). That evening, following several emails and meetings, WSFS management resolved they still needed to authenticate the Red Notice, but in an abundance of caution, placed a “post no debits” (“PND”) restriction on the UDI accounts, effective the next business day, July 16, 2009. (Ex. W-2, WSFS 006171). The PND was put in place to stop automated debiting and allow WSFS time to review UDI’s account and ensure there were sufficient funds for outgoing transfers. (Ex. W-7, Brogan Dep. at 78-79, 81-82).\nThe next morning (Thursday, July 16, 2009), while WSFS continued its investigation, the PND went into effect on a prospective basis. The PND did not prevent transactions already in the system from settling on an automated basis. (Ex. W-7, Brogan Dep. at 78). Consequently, two (2) transfer orders sent to TD Bank (for the benefit of UMI) consisting of six (6) transfers totaling $2,490,150.00 on July 15, 2009 (“the First TD Bank Transfer Order”), and another six (6) transfers totaling $2,689,525.00 on July 16, 2009 (“the Second TD Bank Transfer Order”), settled on July 15 and 16, 2009, respectively. (Ex. W-23, TD 09888-09889, TD 09892; Ex. W-7, Brogan Dep. at 71-72, 75, 78; Ex. W-8, Roberts Report at 21; Ex. W-ll). WSFS quickly requested a reversal of the First TD Bank Transfer Order, which was successful. (Exs. Tr.-41, 42). TD Bank reversed the transaction and returned the funds to WSFS on July 17, 2009. (Ex. W-23, TD 09924). TD Bank refused WSFS’s request to reverse the Second TD Bank Transfer Order for lack of sufficient funds. (Ex. W-105, WSFS 00587; Ex. W-8, Roberts Report at 24; Ex. W-23 at TD 09919-09920).\nBy the end of day on July 16, 2009, after having spoken to two (2) FBI agents, WSFS confirmed that the Red Notice was authentic and there was an actual arrest warrant in India for Singh. (Ex. W-4, WSFS 03844; Ex.W-50, Kearney Dep. at 14-15 (confirming Red Notice was on a valid web site); Ex. Tr.-M, Foley Dep. at 91). WSFS also determined that UDI’s primary operating account was expected to have approximately $5.8 million in it by the close of business that day. (Ex. W-4, WSFS 03844). Accordingly, WSFS decided to transfer $5 million of those funds and credit them to a general ledger suspense account to insure there were funds available to pay off the Loan. (Ex. Tr.-65, WSFS 02456; Ex. W-4, WSFS 03844).\nWSFS put a few other precautionary processes in motion that day. It immediately implemented: UDI’s “line sweep” be turned off, all “money room deposits” be accepted, Foley’s authorization be obtained for cash orders through the “money room vault,” and any communication with Singh should be with Foley. (Exs. Tr.-66, WSFS 05877; Tr.-67, WSFS 05879; Tr.-69, WSFS 05881; Tr.-70, WSFS 05882). Essentially, WSFS wanted to assure that all deposits were accepted and made Foley the point of contact and responsible for determining which debits the bank would permit.\nThursday, July 16, 2009, concluded with Mark Turner, President of WSFS, sending an email (at 8:45 pm) reiterating his message that UDI should be given the benefit of the doubt; that the goal was to protect the bank’s interest while treating UDI with respect and the presumption that it was a misunderstanding. (Ex. W-4, WSFS 03844). At this point, no one from WSFS had contacted UDI to discuss WSFS’ concerns or suspicions about Singh’s identity or to explain the internal actions WSFS had taken pertaining to the UDI accounts. (Ex. W-4, WSFS 03844; Tr.-170).\nThe next morning (Friday, July 17, 2009), WSFS retained Garvan McDaniel as counsel to handle the UDI matter. (Ex. W-52, McDaniel Dep. at 21-22). Thereafter, McDaniel called UDI’s attorney, Kevin Ryan, and advised Ryan (or one of his colleagues) about:\n(1) the Red Notice (which he later emailed to Ryan around noon);\n(2) Singh’s alias;\n(3) the PND restriction;\n(4) the need for the parties to work together and ensure there were sufficient collected funds in the account before attempting to make withdrawals or outgoing transfers;\n(5) WSFS’ placement of $5 million on deposit in a suspense account; and\n(6) WSFS’s right to demand payment of the Loan.\n(Ex. W-9, Ryan Dep. at 34-36; 121; Ex. W-52, McDaniel Dep. at 24, 37-39; Ex. W-54, WSFS 000494; Ex. W-55, WSFS 000495).\nThat afternoon, Ryan asked McDaniel for UDI to have “access to the funds in excess of what [WSFS] needed to offset [the] loan.” (Ex. W-56, WSFS 06756). The two (2) attorneys also scheduled a conference call the following Monday morning. (Ex. W-9, Ryan Dep. at 125). Meanwhile, the PND restriction remained in place.\nOn Monday morning (July 20, 2009), McDaniel advised Ryan that WSFS removed the PND restriction from all accounts, and online banking capabilities for ACH and wire transfers had been reinstated. (Ex. W-67, WSFS 000457). That afternoon, WSFS applied the $5 million that had been previously moved to the general ledger account on July 16th, to formally repay the Loan (“the Setoff’). (Ex. W-60, WSFS 00922; Ex. Tr.-L, Foley Dep. at 198).\n3. effect of the PND\nOn July 15 and 16, 2009, while the PND was in effect, UDI received over $11.6 million dollars in transfers from UMI and UEI (“the UMI-UDI Transfers”). In turn, between July 15 to July 22, 2009, UDI transferred over $11 million out of its WSFS accounts to pay a variety of parties including UMI and UEI (“the Outgoing Transfers”). (Ex. W-8, Roberts Report at 4, 2324). The $11 million in Outgoing Transfers does not include the $5 million transferred to WSFS to repay the Loan.\nOn July 23, 2009, three (3) days after WSFS transferred the $5 million to satisfy the Loan, UMI filed its chapter 11 bankruptcy petition.\nIII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nA. Main Case\nAs stated above, on July 23, 2009, UMI ■commenced this chapter 11 bankruptcy case. The case was converted to chapter 7 on August 18, 2009. On September 24, 2009, the U.S. Trustee filed a report giving notice that Goldstein had been elected as chapter 7 trustee.\nOn April 19, 2010, the Trustee filed a motion requesting that substantive consolidation of the UMI bankruptcy estate with some, but not all, of the non-debtor Universal Network affiliates (“the Substantive Consolidation Motion”). (Bky. No. 09-15404, Doc. # 316). UDI was one of the entities to be included in the substantive consolidation.\nThe Trustee’s request was based largely on his view that:\n• inter-company transfers “of an incredible magnitude” occurred daily without the maintenance of “formal records;”\n• the assets within the Universal Network (largely in the form of cash) “were effectively commingled” that the reconstruction and reconciliation of the accounting records among the separate entities “would be an astronomically expensive, if not impossible, task;” and,\n• certain large creditors “appear to have relied upon the overall financial position of the Universal Network as a whole, as opposed to any one of its discreet member entities.”\n(Memorandum in Support of Trustee’s Motion for Substantive Consolidation at 4-5, 13, 17) (Bky. No. 09-15404, Doc. #317); see generally In re Owens Corning, 419 F.3d 195 (3d Cir.2005) (controlling case stating legal standards for substantive consolidation).\nThe Trustee and TD Bank entered into a settlement resolving several issues between them. Pursuant to that agreement, TD Bank supported the Trustee’s request for substantive consolidation. (Bky. No. 09-15404, Doc. # 366). On June 8, 2010, WSFS filed a lengthy objection to the Substantive Consolidation Motion. (Bky. No. 09-15404, Doc. # 364).\nThe parties reached a global settlement of the Substantive Consolidation Motion and two (2) other pending motions. That settlement was approved by court order dated August 4, 2010. (Bky. No. 09-15404, Doc. # 410).\nThe August 4, 2010 Order provided for the substantive consolidation of the UMI bankruptcy estate nunc pro tunc with five (5) other Universal entities, including UDI (collectively, “the Affiliates”).\nMost relevant to this adversary proceeding, the August 4, 2010 Order included a significant qualification. The Order provided that the substantive consolidation of UMI and UDI would not “impact any rights concerning WSFS.” (Id. ¶ 7). WSFS was excepted from the effects of the substantive consolidation order. Instead, as to WSFS, the parties agreed that the Affiliates, including UDI, would be deemed to have filed a bankruptcy as of August 4, 2010 and that the UDI and UMI estates would be treated as being jointly administered, not substantively consolidated. Significantly, the parties also agreed that the Trustee retained the right to seek to extend the effect of the substantive consolidation to WSFS nunc pro tunc to the date of UMI’s bankruptcy filing, July 23, 2009, with WSFS reserving all of its rights to challenge the request for such relief. (Id. ¶ 7.a.).\nB. Adversary Proceeding\nOn July 18, 2011, the Trustee initiated this adversary proceeding by filing a complaint. (Adv. No. 11-512, Doc. # 1). On January 13, 2012, the Trustee filed an amended complaint. (Id., Doc. #’s 30, 35). WSFS sought dismissal of the initial complaint and, later, the amended complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6)) (incorporated by Fed. R.. Bankr.P. 7012). By order dated June 14, 2012, I granted in part and denied in part WSFS’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint. (Id., Doc. # 43). I also granted the Trustee leave to file a second amended complaint. Initially, the Trustee did not do so. WSFS then filed an Answer to the Amended Complaint on July 18, 2012.\nOn December 6, 2013, the Trustee filed a motion seeking leave to file a second amended complaint. (Id., Doc. # 129). WSFS objected. By Order dated January 15, 2014, I granted the motion. (Id., Doc. # 161). The Trustee filed his second amended complaint (“the Second Amended Complaint”) on January 24, 2014. (Id., Doc. # 170). WSFS filed its Answer on February 19, 2014. (Id., Doc. # 176).\nSix (6) of the original ten (10) claims pleaded in the Amended Complaint survived WSFS’ Motion to Dismiss Case, in whole or in part. Those surviving claims are:\nCount One — in contract, for breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing;\nCount Two — breach of contract;\nCount Three — under 6 Del. C. § 4A-305 for failure to execute two (2) “payment orders;”\nCount Six — avoidance and recovery of fraudulent transfers under 11 U.S.C. §§ 544 and 550;\nCount Seven — avoidance and recovery of fraudulent transfers under 11 U.S.C. §§ 548 and 550;\nCount Eight — avoidance of setoff under 11 U.S.C. §§ 553 and 550.\nBy order dated September 24, 2012, after consideration of their Rule 26(f) Discovery Report, a number of conferences with counsel and additional status reports, I entered a pretrial order that set July 81, 2013 as the deadline for completion of all discovery. (Adv. No. 11-512, Doc. # 69). The parties then engaged in extensive discovery—for the most part, in a collaborative, cooperative manner — and requested a number of extensions of the discovery deadline. By virtue of Pretrial Order # 10, dated April 23, 2014, all discovery concluded on June 18, 2014. (Id., Doc. # 182).\nOn May 30, 2014, the Trustee filed a motion for partial summary judgment, seeking summary judgment as to liability only with respect to Counts One, Two, Three, She and Seven. (IcL, Doc. # 193). The Trustee supported his motion with evidentiary matter and a memorandum of law. On July 31, 2014, WSFS filed its response to the Trustee’s Motion and its own motion for summary judgment with accompanying evidentiary matter and a memorandum of law. (Id., Doc. #206). Each side then filed reply memoranda, the last of which was filed on September 11, 2014. (Id., Doe. #’s 213, 216).\nIV. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), applicable in this adversary proceeding by virtue of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7056, provides that summary judgment must be granted to a moving party when, drawing all reasonable infer-enees in favor of the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. E.g., Tri-M Group, LLC v. Sharp, 638 F.3d 406, 415 (3d Cir.2011); In re Bath, 442 B.R. 377, 387 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.2010). Summary judgment is appropriate if there are no disputed issues of material fact and the undisputed facts would require a directed verdict in favor of the movant. See Fitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, 2 F.3d 1112, 1115 (11th Cir.1993).\nOn a motion for summary judgment, the court’s role is not to weigh the evidence, but to determine whether there is a disputed, material fact for resolution at trial. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A genuine issue of material fact is one in which sufficient evidence exists that would permit a reasonable fact finder to return a verdict for the non-moving party. Id. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505. However, if it appears that the evidence “is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law,” the court shall enter judgment accordingly in that party’s favor. Id. at 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505.\nProper resolution of a motion for summary judgment also requires consideration of the parties’ respective burdens.\nIf the moving party bears the burden of proof, the movant must “support its motion with credible evidence ... that would entitle it to a directed verdict if not controverted at trial.” Fitzpatrick, 2 F.3d at 1115 (citation omitted). The evidence must establish “all the essential elements of its case on which it bears the burden of proof at trial, [such that] no reasonable jury could find for the non-moving party.” Id. (citation omitted); see also Bath, 442 B.R. at 387. If the movant (with the burden of proof at trial) meets this initial burden, the responding party may not rest on the pleadings, but must designate specific factual averments through the use of affidavits or other permissible evidentiary material which demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact to be resolved at trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505.\nIf the moving party does not bear the burden of proof at trial, the movant may establish it is entitled to judgment either by demonstrating that the undisputed facts negate an element of the plaintiffs claim or that the plaintiff lacks evidence to support an essential element of his claim. In re Polichuk, 506 B.R. 405, 422 (Bankr. E.D.Pa.2014) (citing Orson, Inc. v. Miramax Film Corp., 79 F.3d 1358, 1366 (3d Cir.1996) and Quaker Stpie Minit-Lube, Inc. v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co., 868 F.Supp. 1278, 1287 n. 5 (D.Utah 1994)).\nIn this adversary proceeding, with respect to certain claims, WSFS contends that the Trustee’s evidence is insufficient to permit this dispute to proceed to trial. Thus, WSFS’ burden on summary judgment “may be discharged by ‘showing’— that is, pointing out to the [trial] court—that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).\nV. WSFS IS ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE TRUSTEE’S CONTRACT CLAIMS (COUNTS ONE AND TWO)\nIn Counts One and Two of the Second Amended Complaint, the Trustee asserts two (2) distinct breach of contract claims pertaining to the Loan and the CMA: (1) breach of express contractual provisions and (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\nA. Threshold Issue: the Relationship between the Loan and the CMA\nPrior to evaluating whether there was a breach of contract under either theory, I must consider the relationship between the Loan and the CMA. The Trustee contends that the Loan and CMA are separate contracts. (Trustee Reply Memorandum Support of Summary Judgment at 3; Adv. No. 11-512, Doc. #213) (“Tr.Reply”). WSFS disagrees, arguing that the Loan and CMA were part of a larger integrated business lending transaction that requires the documents to be interpreted as a single agreement in order to give effect to the parties’ intent.\nThe distinction is important. If the Loan and the CMA are part of a single contractual relationship, WSFS’ argument that UDI’s alleged material breach of the Loan excuses performance under the CMA gains traction.\n1. contract interpretation\nIt is a well settled under Delaware contract law, that the best evidence of the parties’ intent is the written contact. Paul v. Deloitte & Touche LLP, 974 A.2d 140, 145 (Del.2009) (explaining that court must look to the “four corners of the contract to conclude whether the intent of the parties can be determined from its express language”).\nIt is the duty of a Court to give effect to the intentions of the parties to a contract, the writing being the embodiment of a jural act by the parties. In well-drawn and unambiguous contracts ... the plain meaning of the words used by the parties will be given full force and effect, and extrinsic evidence will not be admitted.\nSchwartz v. Centennial Ins. Co., 1980 WL 77940, at *5 (Del.Ch. Jan. 16, 1980) (citations omitted); accord Northwestern Nat’l Ins. Co. v. Esmark, Inc., 672 A.2d 41, 43 (Del.1996); Tenneco Auto. Inc. v. El Paso Corp., 2002 WL 453930, at *1 (Del.Ch. Mar. 20, 2002).\nA further axiom of contact interpretation is that related agreements are to be read together as one contract. Ashall Homes Ltd. v. ROK Entm’t Grp. Inc., 992 A.2d 1239, 1251 (Del.Ch.2010); accord In re Northwestern Corp., 313 B.R. 595, 601 (Bankr.D.Del.2004) (“all related documents and instruments in a single transaction together are harmonized to the extent possible”). “[T]he principle that all writings which are part of the same transaction are interpreted together also applies when incorporation by reference of another writing may be inferred from the context surrounding the execution of the writings in question.” Williston on Contracts § 30:26 (4th ed. (rev.) 2007) (“Williston”); accord CA, Inc. v. Ingres Corp., 2009 WL 4575009, at *47 (Del.Ch. Dec. 7, 2009); Simon v. Navellier Series Fund, 2000 WL 1597890, at *7 (Del.Ch. Oct. 19, 2000).\n2. integration\nWhere one party to a contract seeks to vary the terms of a written contract, the parol evidence rule is implicated. The parol evidence rule states “where parties have reduced their ultimate agreement to writing, the writing cannot thereafter be varied or contradicted.” McGrew v. Vanguard Corp., 1979 WL 4635, at *3 (Del.Ch. Sept. 25, 1979); accord Taylor v. Jones, 2002 WL 31926612, at *3 (Del.Ch. Dec. 17, 2002). The application of the parol evidence rule operates to exclude “an antecedent or contemporaneous oral understanding to vary or contradict the terms of a written contract.” Brandywine Shoppe, Inc. v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., 307 A.2d 806, 809 (Del.Super.Ct.1973).\nRelated to the parole evidence rule is the concept of contract integration. A distinction exists between contracts that are totally integrated and those only partially integrated:\nWhere the writing is intended to be final and complete, it is characterized as a total integration and may be neither contradicted nor supplemented by evidence of prior agreements. But where a writing is intended to be final but is in fact incomplete it is said to consist of a partial integration and although such a writing may not be contradicted by evidence of prior agreements, it may be supplemented by additional consistent evidence.\nMcGrew, 1979 WL 4635, at *3 (footnote omitted).\nIn determining whether the contract is fully or partially integrated, courts consider several factors, including whether the contact contains a merger or integration clause, the length and detail of the contract, the formality of the setting, and whether the contract is a form. See 6-25 Peter Linzer, Corbin on Contacts § 25.7 (Joseph M. Perillo, ed.) (Matthew Bender 2015) (“Corbin”); see also Hynansky v. Vietri, 2003 WL 21976031, at *3 (Del.Ch. Aug. 7, 2003); Taylor, 2002 WL 31926612, at *3.\nOnce it has been established that a contract is not fully integrated, the court may consider extrinsic or parol evidence regarding whether the parties intended to include other terms or agreements in the contract to supplement (but not vary or contradict) the written terms of the contract. Corbin § 25.7; see also Brandywine Shoppe, 307 A.2d at 809.\nIn this proceeding, I must apply these principles to determine whether the Loan and the CMA were each fully integrated, independent contracts or whether each was only partially integrated and supplemented by the provisions of the other.\n3. the Loan and CMA each were only partially integrated\nThe inclusion of an integration clause in a written contract is evidence that a contract is fully integrated, but by itself, is not conclusive. Li v. Standard Fiber, LLC, 2013 WL 1286202, at *7 n. 57 (Del.Ch. Mar. 28, 2013); MicroStrategy Inc. v. Acacia Research Corp., 2010 WL 5550455, at *13 (Del.Ch. Dec. 30, 2010). In this matter, the Loan has an integration clause, (see Ex. W-14, WSFS 00270, BLA ¶ 6.8), but it is not possible at summary judgment, to determine whether the CMA has one.\nThe Note expressly incorporates the BLA, (Note, Preamble) and refers to the BLA and the other Loan Documents as one collective transaction or one interrelated instrument. (Ex. W14, WSFS 00276, Note ¶ 3(a)). More to the point, the Note specifically provides that UDI must maintain its primary deposit account and cash management relationship with WSFS and the failure to do so constituted an event of default. (Id., WSFS 00278, Note ¶ 6(d); see also id., WSFS 00264, BLA ¶ 4.1 (k)). This requirement merged the lending and banking relationships.\nIt is therefore readily apparent that the CMA was only one (1) part of the larger transaction which included WSFS’ agreement to lend UDI $5 million for working capital. The Trustee has offered no extrinsic evidence to dispute that the Loan and CMA were two (2) parts of a single package.\nThese undisputed facts establish that the Loan and CMA both were only partially integrated. Each writing was the final manifestation of the agreements on the subjects addressed within each agreement. However, neither one, standing alone, represented the parties’ complete agreement. Each agreement supplemented the other, together forming a single integrated transaction. Consequently, the Loan and CMA must be interpreted together as parts of a single contract.\nB. Trustee’s Claim for Breach of Express Contract Provisions (Count Two)\nThree (3) elements are required to establish breach of contract under Delaware law: (1) the existence of a contract whether express or implied; (2) the breach of an obligation imposed by that contract; and (3) the resultant damage to the plaintiff. VLIW Technology, LLC v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 840 A.2d 606, 612 (Del.2003); eCOMMERCE Indus., Inc. v. MWA Intelligence, Inc., 2013 WL 5621678, *13 (Del. Ch. Sept. 30, 2013); In re Mobilactive Media, LLC, 2013 WL 297950, at *14 (Del. Ch. Jan. 25, 2013). The plaintiff has the burden to establish these elements by a preponderance of the evidence. Mobilactive Media, 2013 WL 297950, at *14; La-Point v. AmerisourceBergen Corp., 2007 WL 2565709, at *9 (Del.Ch. Sept. 4, 2007).\n1. WSFS Non-Performance under the CMA was excused by UDI’s material breach of the Loan\na.\nThe Trustee’s first argument under Count Two is that WSFS breached the CMA through the implementation of the PND and other actions that restricted UDI’s use of services that were provided under the CMA. The Trustee also makes the related argument that WSFS committed a breach of its express contractual duties by failing to perform all of its obligations under the CMA without prior notice. In response, WSFS asserts that it was excused from fully performing under the CMA due to UDI’s material breach of its obligations under the Loan Documents.\nWSFS is correct on the law. “A party is excused from performance under a contract if the other party is in material breach thereof.” BioLife Solutions, Inc. v. Endocare, Inc., 838 A.2d 268, 278 (Del. Ch.2003) (citing Moore Bus. Forms v. Cordant Holdings Corp., 1998 WL 71836, at *8 & n. 35 (Del.Ch. Feb. 6, 1998, revised Mar. 5, 1998)); accord Daystar Const. Mgmt., Inc. v. Mitchell, 2006 WL 2053649, at *7 (Del.Super. July 12, 2006).\nBased on this legal principle, if UDI materially defaulted under the Loan, it is appropriate to treat the default provisions of the Loan as either terminating WSFS’ ongoing obligations under the CMA or at least modifying those obligations to relieve WSFS of the obligation to perform those CMA obligations that were inconsistent with or that would undermine the efficacy of its loan default remedies. As stated earlier, the CMA and the Loan were two (2) parts of a single, integrated transaction. It would be illogical to construe the transaction documents as permitting WSFS to declare a default under the Loan Documents and exercise its default and collection remedies only to have the exercise of those remedies trigger a breach of its obligations under the CMA. See GMG Capital Invs., LLC v. Athenian Venture Partners I, L.P., 36 A.3d 776, 779 (Del. 2012) (“The meaning inferred from a particular provision cannot control the meaning of the entire agreement if such an inference conflicts with the agreement’s overall scheme or plan.” (citing E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., 498 A.2d 1108, 1113 (1985))).\nConsequently, the merits of the Trustee’s breach of contract claim boils down to two (2) questions:\n(1) Was UDI in default of the Loan?\n(2) If so, was the default material?\nBased on the undisputed facts, the answer to both questions is “yes.” The summary judgment record establishes as a matter of law that UDI was in material breach of the Loan Documents at the time WSFS took action after discovering the existence of the Red Notice. Therefore, WSFS was authorized to accelerate the Loan and was not required to strictly perform all of its obligations under the CMA and did not breach its contractual duties to UDI.\nb.\nThe BLA identifies fourteen (14) “Events of Default.” (Ex. W-14, WSFS 00266-00267, BLA ¶ 5.1(a)-(n)). WSFS has established on this record that at least two (2) events of default under the BLA occurred before it exercised its loan default remedies.\nOne event of default occurred under Paragraph 5.1(h) of the BLA, which states that the following constitutes an event of default: “[UDI] makes any material false or misleading statement, certificate, representation or warranty to [WSFS].”\nAmong the representations and warranties that UDI made to WSFS in the BLA were that:\n• the financial statements that UDI and Singh delivered to UDI were true and correct and presented their financial position fairly accurately and completely;\n• UDI had disclosed in writing all facts that could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition or any loan collateral; and\n• UDI was not obligated under any guaranty other than a guaranty in favor of WSFS.\n(Id., WSFS 00261, BLA ¶ 3.1(e), (f), (g)).\nWSFS has produced evidence, unrebut-ted by the Trustee, that UDI made the following misrepresentations to WSFS:\n• UDI submitted false financial statements which overstated UDI’s cash position by more than $2 million and its net worth by over $3.3 million;\n• UDI falsely represented that there were no inter-company balances;\n• UDI falsely represented that it had no guarantee obligations, when it had $32 million in guarantee obligations;\n• UDI failed to disclose significant losses caused by environmental factors at the Duncan gas stations which was the subject of a lawsuit at the time.\nAnother event of default occurred under Paragraph 5.1(b) of the BLA, which states that the following constitutes an event of default: the occurrence of an “Event of Default” under any of the other Loan Documents. An event of default occurred under another one of the Loan Documents: specifically, Paragraph 7 of the Guaranty.\nParagraph 7 of the Guaranty provided that an event of default occurs if any information given by Singh or UDI in connection with the Loan is not accurate in all material respects or if either Singh or UDI “omitted to state any material fact or any fact necessary to make such information not misleading.” In the Certificate of Guaranty Singh submitted to WSFS, Singh falsely certified that “[t]here is no suit, action, or proceeding pending, or threatened against or affecting the Guarantor before or by any court, administrative agency, [or] other governmental authority.” (Ex. W-14, WSFS 00332, Certificate of Guarantor ¶ 3).\nSingh’s failure to disclose the existence of the litigation against him in India and the Red Notice (in the name of his undisclosed alias, Batra) constituted an event of default under the Guaranty and therefore under Paragraph 5.1(b) of the BLA.\nc.\nThe next question is whether UDI’s default under the Loan Documents, on account of the material misrepresentations regarding UDI and Singh’s financial condition and the failure to disclose the Red Notice and the pending criminal charges in India against Singh, were material breaches that excused further strict contractual performance by WSFS. I conclude they were.\nThe determination whether a breach is sufficient to excuse further performance under a contract is one of degree. Preferred Inv. Servs., Inc. v. T & H Bail Bonds, Inc., 2013 WL 3934992, at *11 (Del.Ch. July 24, 2013). A material breach is action or inaction that goes to the root or “essence of the agreement between the parties, or ... which touches the fundamental purpose of the contract and defeats the object of the parties in entering into the contract.” Id. It must be “of sufficient importance to justify by the non-breaching party.” Biolife Solutions, 838 A.2d at 278.\n“A misrepresentation is material if it would be likely to induce a reasonable person to manifest his assent, or if the maker knows that it would be likely to induce the recipient to do so.” Restatement § 162(2); accord Alabi v. DHL Airways, Inc., 583 A.2d 1358, 1362 (Del.Super.Ct.1990). Further, a party may assert that its nonperformance is excused by the other party’s material breaches, even if it was not aware of those breaches at the time it terminated or modiñed its performance under the parties’ contract. See, e.g., Eastern Elec. & Heating, Inc. v. Pike Creek Professional Ctr., 1987 WL 9610, at *5 (Del.Super.Ct. Apr. 7, 1987); see also Schiavello v. Delmarva Sys. Corp., 61 F.Supp.2d 110, 114 (D.Del.1999) (after-acquired evidence of resume fraud is complete defense, to breach of contract claim); Davenport Group MG, L.P. v. Strategic Inv. Partners, 685 A.2d 715, 724 (Del.Ch. 1996) (later-discovered information of wrongdoing is defense to wrongful discharge suit).\nThe determination of materiality is usually a question of fact. Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Basell USA Inc., 512 F.3d 86, 92 (3d Cir.2008) (citing Saienni v. G & C Capital Group, Inc., 1997 WL 363919, at *3 (Del.Super.Ct. May 1, 1997)); 23 Willi-ston § 63:3. However, the materiality determination does not always preclude summary judgment. “[I]f the issue is disputed ... [but] there is only one reasonable conclusion, a court must address what is ordinarily a factual question as a question of law.” 23 Williston § 63:3; accord Nor folk, 512 F.3d at 92 (applying Delaware law); Saienni 1997 WL 363919, at *2, 3.\nHere, consistent with its usual underwriting practices, before it entered into the lending relationship with UDI, WSFS required that UDI and Singh provide financial statements and related financial information.. (Ex. W-19, Foley Dep. at 6-9). WSFS analyzed this information in the form of a credit memo presented to its Senior Loan Committee, which assessed UDI’s financial strength and the risk of extending credit. Based upon the information and risk analysis contained in that memo, WSFS granted UDI the Loan. (See Ex. W-37, Kocher Dep. at 18-19).\nThe Credit Memo referred specifically to UDI’s cash position of $2.1 million as “sufficient.” (Ex. W-31, WSFS 00530). As for Singh, UDI representatives required his guaranty before the Credit Memo was submitted to the Senior Loan Committee. (See W-37; Kocher Dep. at 20). At the Senior Loan Committee level, the Credit Memo separately analyzed the financial status of Singh, its guarantor. (Ex. W-31, WSFS 00532).\nThis record establishes, as a matter of law, that the misrepresentations in UDI’s financial disclosures substantially contributed to WSFS’ extension of credit under the Loan. Alabi, 583 A.2d at 1363 (“A misrepresentation induces a party’s manifestation of assent if it substantially contributes to his decision to manifest his assent.” (citation omitted)); see also Kirchner v. Stief, 2001 WL 1555313, at *3 (Del.C.P.2001) (“It is assumed, in absence of facts showing the contrary, that the recipient attached importance to the truth of the misrepresentation ...” (quoting Alabi, 583 A.2d at 1363)). In fact, the BLA itself states that the financial and related covenants induced WSFS to make the Loan to UDI.\nSimilarly, as a matter of law, Singh’s nondisclosure of the pending proceedings against him in India, was a material breach of his contractual disclosure obligations under the Guaranty. The record demonstrates that WSFS made the Loan largely on the strength of its confidence in UDI’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow. (See Ex. W-31, Credit Mem.; Ex. W-37, Kocher Dep. at 28). UDI’s financial strength, in turn, was based on its success as a functioning cog in the Universal Network. The Credit Memo confirms that WSFS was well aware that Singh was the principal of all of the key Universal Network entities. In these circumstances, it is obvious that WSFS’ decision to grant the loan necessarily depended on its confidence in Singh as the principal of UDI and the other Universal Network entities. See Ronald J. Mann, Article: The Role of Secured Credit in Small-Business Lending, 86 Geo. L.J. 1, at *6, 23-24 (Oct.1997) (discussing lenders’ uniform practice of securing personal guarantee and describing guarantee as “a major force” in small business lending where “the most important effect of the guaranty is not the direct enhancement of the creditor’s right to collect payment forcibly, but is instead the improvement of the borrower’s incentives”); see also David Hahn, Personal Bankruptcy in the 21st Century: Emerging Trends and New Challenges: Velvet Bankruptcy, 7 Theoretical Inq. L. 523, 531-32 (July 2006) (banks’ demand for personal guarantees is “a contractual bypass of the legal principle of limited liability” which serves as a “bonding device that combats the perils of excessive risk-taking at the corporate level”). This renders material the nondisclosure of the prior legal proceedings against him in India and the existence of the Red Notice international arrest warrant, nondisclosures that constituted events of default under Paragraph 7 of the Guaranty and Paragraph 5.1 of the BLA. See RTP LLC v. ORIX Real Estate Capital, Inc., 2014 WL 4414512, at *7-8 (N.D.Ill. Sept. 8, 2014) (holding guarantor’s failure to disclose lawsuit, in which court imposed a temporary restraining order was material breach under loan agreement).\nIn short, WSFS having established that UDI was in material breach of the Loan at the time that WSFS discovered the existence of the Red Notice, the Trustee cannot succeed on his claim for express breach of WSFS’ contractual obligations under the CMA.\n2. WSFS did not commit a breach of contract by failing to give prior notice before exercising its remedies under the Loan Documents\nThe Trustee also argues that WSFS committed a breach of contract by failing to give UDI prior notice before it exercised its Loan default remedies. The argument is without merit.\nThe express terms of the BLA provided WSFS with the right' to accelerate the Loan without a declaration of default and without notice to UDI. (Ex. W-14, WSFS 00267, BLA ¶ 5.2(a), (b)). The Trustee seeks to vitiate the effect of this express contractual provision, arguing that the notice provisions in the Loan Documents are ambiguous because some of the remedial provisions require that notice be given to UDI while others are silent on the subject. (Tr. Reply Mem. at 5). Based on this purported ambiguity, the Trustee invokes the doctrine of contra proferentum and asks the court to construe the notice provisions against the drafter of the contract. He requests the court to read into the provisions of the Loan Documents that lack an express prior notice requirement, a duty to provide prior notice before exercising default remedies. (Id. at 5-6).\nAs a general rule, contract terms should be given their plain and ordinary meaning. E.g., AT & T Corp. v. Lillis, 953 A.2d 241, 252 (Del.2008); 11 Williston § 32.3. A contract term or provision is ambiguous only “[w]hen the provisions in controversy are fairly susceptible of different interpretations or may have two or more different meanings.” GMG Capital Invs., 36 A.3d at 780 (quoting Eagle Indus, v. DeVilbiss Health Care, 702 A.2d 1228, 1232 (Del.1997)); accord Rhone-Poulenc Basic Chem. Co. v. Am. Motorists Ins. Co., 616 A.2d 1192, 1196 (Del.1992). However, a contract is not ambiguous simply because the parties do not agree on its proper meaning. GMG Capital Invs., 36 A.3d at 780.\nIn the event of an ambiguity, sometimes courts will “adopt the meaning that is less favorable in its legal effect to the party who chose the words ... [a] technique known ... as ‘contra proferentem.’ ” 5-24 Corbin § 24.27; accord 11 Williston § 32:12. Under Delaware law, courts may apply this principle if alternative formulations indicate that the ambiguous provision could easily have been made clear by the drafting party. Twin City Fire Ins. Co. v. Delaware Racing Ass’n, 840 A.2d 624, 630 (Del.2003) (citing Kaiser Alum. Corp. v. Matheson, 681 A.2d 392, 399 (Del.1996)).\nIn his submission, the Trustee did not go through the Loan Documents and identify those remedies that require prior notice and flesh out the ambiguity he claims exists. Presumably, he is referring to ¶ 6(a) and (b) of the Note, which require fifteen (15) days prior notice before WSFS declares certain monetary defaults. Interestingly, the very next subparagraph of the Note, ¶ 6(c), authorizes WSFS to declare a default without notice in the event of a materially adverse change in UDI’s financial condition or with respect to the collateral of the Loan. In any event, there is no ambiguity in the provisions of the Loan Documents.\nThe Trustee’s argument fails because there is no contractual ambiguity on the subject of prior notice.\nThe BLA expressly states that WSFS may accelerate the Loan without a declaration of default and exercise its default remedies without notice to UDI. (Ex. W-14, WSFS 00267, BLA ¶ 5.2(a), (b)). The existence of a generally applicable provision, stating that notice is not required for declaration of a default and the exercise of a party’s remedies, with another provision imposing a notice requirement before a default may . be declared based on a certain, specific ground, does not create an ambiguity. As the Restatement points out, the specific may control over the general, but only in the context in which it is found in a contract; it does not replace or supersede the general contract provision:\n[I]n case of conflict the specific or exact term is more likely to express the meaning of the parties with respect to the situation than the general language ... [but if] the specific or exact can be read as an exception or qualification of the general, both are given some effect.-\nSee Restatement § 203, cmt. e.\nHere, there is neither an internal conflict within the BLA nor a direct conflict between the BLA and another one of the Loan Documents. WSFS declared a default and exercised its default remedies based on a non-monetary default for which there is no express contractual duty to give prior notice. The fact that there are other events of default as to which there is a duty to give notice does not create an ambiguity or vitiate WSFS’ express right to act without notice following a non-monetary default.\nAccordingly, the Trustee has not identified any specific contract provision mandating prior notice with which WSFS failed to comply.\nC. Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (Count One)\nThe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing requires contracting parties to “ ‘refrain from arbitrary or unreasonable conduct which has the effect of preventing the other party to the contract from receiving the fruits’ of the bargain.” Dunlap v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 878 A.2d 434, 442 (Del.2005) (emphasis added) (quoting Wilgus v. Salt Pond Inv. Co., 498 A.2d 151, 159 (Del.Ch.1986)); accord Nemec v. Shrader, 991 A.2d 1120, 1126 (Del.2010). Breaching the covenant may create liability for parties whose “conduct frustrates the ‘overarching purpose’ of the contract by taking advantage of their position to control implementation of the agreement’s terms.” Dunlap, 878 A.2d at 442 (citing Breakaway Solutions, Inc. v. Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc., 2004 WL 1949300 *12 (Del.Ch. Aug. 27, 2004)). The doctrine may be used to imply contract terms, “whether employed to analyze unanticipated developments or to fill gaps in the contract’s provisions.” Dunlap, 878 A.2d at 441 (footnote omitted).\nThe Delaware Supreme Court has emphasized the limited nature of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. A contracting party’s reliance on the express terms of an agreement does not amount to bad faith merely because such reliance “simply limits advantages to another party.” Nemec, 991 A.2d at 1128. Therefore, applying the implied covenant to find that a party breached its obligations by the manner in which it employed an express contractual right is a “cautious enterprise.” Id. at 1125 (citing Dunlap, 878 A.2d at 441). This is necessarily so because a plaintiff “generally cannot base a claim for breach of the implied covenant on conduct authorized by the agreement.” Id. at 1125-26.\nApplication of the implied covenant involves a “rare and fact-intensive exercise,” Dunlap, 878 A.2d at 442 (quoting Cincinnati SMSA Ltd. Partnership v. Cincinnati Bell Cellular Systems Co., 708 A.2d 989, 992 (Del.1998)), to be employed “[o]nly when it is clear from the writing that the contracting parties ‘would have agreed to proscribe the act later complained of ... had they thought to negotiate with respect to that matter,’ ” Dunlap, 878 A.2d at 442 (quoting Katz v. Oak Industries, Inc., 508 A.2d 873, 880 (Del.Ch. 1986)).\nStated slightly differently, and consistent with the contractual foundation of a claim for breach of an implied contractual duty,\nDelaware’s implied duty of good faith and fair dealing is not an equitable remedy for rebalancing economic interests after [subsequent] events ... adversely affected one party to a contract. Rather the covenant is a limited and extraordinary legal remedy.\neCOMMERCE Indus., 2013 WL 5621678, at *33 (citing Nemec, 991 A.2d at 1128).\nA claim arising from a breach of the implied covenant is itself contractual in nature. NAMA Holdings, LLC v. Related WMCLLC, 2014 WL 6436647, at *16 (Del.Ch. Nov. 17, 2014) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Thus, the elements of the claim are the same as those for an ordinary breach of contract claim, the only difference being that contractual obligation breached is implied, not express. See NAMA Holdings, 2014 WL 6436647 at *16 (quoting Fitzgerald v. Can tor, 1998 WL 842316, at *1 (Del.Ch. Nov. 10, 1998)). The implied covenant is not met by “[g]eneral allegations of bad faith conduct.” Kuroda v. SPJS Holdings, LLC, 971 A.2d 872, 888 (Del.Ch.2009). Instead, Delaware courts require the plaintiff to identify a specific implied obligation and to demonstrate that the breach of that obligation “denied the plaintiff the fruits of the contract.” Id.\nAs explained in Part V.B. above, following a material breach by UDI, WSFS exercised its default remedies under the Loan. Based on the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the Trustee argues that the manner in which WSFS implemented its default remedies was unreasonable and in bad faith. He contends that WSFS breached the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing by placing the administrative freeze on UDI’s accounts, sequestering $5 million to an internal account for the purpose of setting off the Loan, and failing to give notice to UDI of the administrative freeze and the sequestration of funds.\nThe Trustee’s contention, that WSFS’ conduct was arbitrary and unreasonable, is not supported by the undisputed facts in the record.\nFor the few days the PND was in effect, WSFS' continued to honor requests for transfers and otherwise made funds available to UDI. The PND only removed automation from the process, thereby enabling WSFS to manually ensure there were available funds in the accounts sufficient to cover the transfers (and to stop payment if the available funds were insufficient). (Ex. W-7, Brogan Dep. at 78-79, 82). The net effect was that the PND merely stopped the automatic funding of outgoing transfers with provisional or advance credit. WSFS had the right to do this in light of UDI’s material breach of the parties’ contract.\nThus, there is no evidence that UDI lacked all access to its funds. Rather, from July 15 to July 22, 2009, UDI transferred over $11 million from its accounts (not including the $5 million used to repay the WSFS Loan). (Ex. W-7, Brogan Dep. at 81-83; Ex. W-8, Roberts Report at 4, 23-24; Ex. W-12, Manderino Dep. at 113, 116-118). More specifically, in the week after WSFS discovered the Red Notice, WSFS permitted UDI to withdraw from its accounts: $3 million, sent to UEI; $5.8 million, sent to UMI and sixty-seven (67) payments to . third parties totaling $212,000.00. (See Ex. W-12, Manderino Dep. at 117-118). In this regard, it is most telling that there is nothing in the record that suggests that UDI attempted to write checks or otherwise effect transfers from its accounts to non-Universal Network third parties and was unable to do so between July 16, 2009 and July 19, 20Q9, the dates the PND restriction was in effect.\nThus, the. uncontroverted facts demonstrate that UDI’s accounts were not entirely frozen and that millions of dollars flowed through them while the PND restriction was in place. WSFS continued processing transactions in and out of UDI’s accounts, albeit at a slower pace and without the automatic grant of provisional credit for all transactions provided under the terms of the CMA. In effect, the PND did little more than temporarily suspend UDI’s ability to take advantage of the provisional credit facility within the CMA. And, the Trustee made no showing that the segregation (and ultimately, the set-off) of the $5 million resulted in a default on any particular obligation by UMI, UDI or any other entity within the Universal Network.\nAs for the Trustee’s claim that WSFS’ actions without prior notice was a distinct breach of its contractual obligations, the Loan Documents imposed no duty on WSFS to give such notice. Nor did WSFS keep UDI in the dark about the limitations imposed on the CMA for very long. On July 17, 2009 — one day after the PND went into effect — WSFS gave notice to UDI (through its counsel) that it had: (a) put the PND in place, (b) segregated the $5 million, and (c) intended to set off the $5 million against the Loan.\nAside from the Trustee’s over-spin of the factual history, WSFS’ conduct was entirely consistent with the terms of the parties’ agreement. In the event of default, the Loan provided that WSFS could, without notice, set off the Loan against amounts in UDI’s depository accounts. The Loan was conditioned on the CMA being at WSFS and would not have been granted otherwise. Having its cash management system at WSFS was specifically designed to give WSFS security with respect to the Loan. What occurred was exactly what WSFS bargained for before it entered into its commercial relationship with UDI.\nIn short, WSFS did not overreact; its response to the disturbing information it received about the principal of its customer was not disproportionate. WSFS’ conduct was a measured response to its reasonable suspicion that UDI materially defaulted under the Loan Agreement because the principal of a borrower that was transferring large sums of cash on a daily basis was an international fugitive operating under an assumed name. WSFS administered the PND in a manner that was restrictive enough to protect its interests and no more. The undisputed facts depict bank conduct that is far below the “arbitrary” or “unreasonable” standard required in a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. No reasonable factfinder could find otherwise.\nVII. WSFS IS ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE TRUSTEE’S CLAIM UNDER 6 Del. C. § 4A (COUNT THREE)\nA. 6 Del. C. § 4A-305\nArticle 4A governs electronic funds transfers, specifically payment orders. See 6 Del. C. §§ 4A-101, et. seq. Generally, a payment order is “an instruction of a sender to a receiving bank, transmitted orally, electronically, or in writing, to pay, or to cause another bank to pay, a fixed or determinable amount of money to a beneficiary.” § 4A—103 (a) (1).\nArticle 4A defines several of the relevant terms used to describe a payment order. A sender is “the person giving the instruction to the receiving bank.” § 4A-103(a)(5). The receiving bank is “the bank to which the sender’s instruction is addressed.” § 4A-103(a)(4). A beneficiary bank is “the bank identified in a payment order in which an account of the beneficiary is to be credited pursuant to the order or which otherwise is to make payment to the beneficiary if the order does not provide for payment to an account.” § 4A-103(a)(3). A beneficiary is “the person to be paid by the beneficiary’s bank.” § 4A-103(a)(2).\nIn essence, a payment order can be broken down into a chain of transactions that may either be “accepted” or “rejected” at any point in the chain. For instance, a receiving bank may either accept or reject a payment order that the sender transmits. “[A] receiving bank ... accepts a payment order when it executes the order.” § 4A-209(a). A rejection occurs when the receiving bank issues a notice to the sender either orally, electronically, or in writing that indicates that the receiving bank “is rejecting the order or will not execute or pay the order.” § 4A-210(a). Once a payment order is accepted it may not then be later rejected and vice versa. See Banque Worms v. BankAmerica Int'l 77 N.Y.2d 362, 568 N.Y.S.2d 541, 570 N.E.2d 189, 195 (1991) (“Payments made by electronic funds transfers in compliance with the provisions of article 4A are to be the equivalent of cash payments, irrevocable except to the extent provided for in article 4A”).\nA payment order is executed by a receiving bank when “it issues a payment order intended to carry out the payment order received by [that] bank.” 1-2 Benjamin Geva, The Law of Electronic Funds Transfers § 2.03[2] (Matthew Bender 2015) (quoting U.C.C. § 4A-301(a)).\nSection 4A-305 governs a receiving bank’s liability for late or improper execution or failure to execute payment order. It provides:\n(a) If a funds transfer is completed but execution of a payment order by the receiving bank in breach of Section 4A-302 results in delay in payment to the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to pay interest to either the originator or the beneficiary of the funds transfer for the period of delay caused by the improper execution. Except as provided in subsection (e), additional damages are not recoverable.\n(b) If execution of a payment order by a receiving bank in breach of Section 4A-302 results in (i) noncompletion of the funds transfer, (ii) failure to use an intermediary bank designated by the originator, or (iii) issuance of a payment order that does not comply with the terms of the payment order of the originator, the bank is liable to the originator for its expenses in the funds transfer and for incidental expenses and interest losses, to the extent not covered by subsection (a), resulting from the improper execution. Except as provided in subsection (c), additional damages are not recoverable.\n(c) In addition to the amounts payable under subsections (a) and (b), damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express written agreement of the receiving bank.\nB. The CMA\nOne of the documents executed by the parties as part of the CMA was the Funds Transfer Services Rider (“the FTS Rider”). (Ex. W-38, WSFS 01535-01545). Section 2 of the FTS Rider listed eight (8) services regarding payment orders to be paid through the cash management system. All of the services were worded in terms of “may” as opposed to shall. For instance, in the execution of payment orders, WSFS may execute each order received by it in the name of UDI as sender, provided that UDI had sufficient available funds on deposit in an account. (See Id., WSFS 01535, FTS Rider ¶ 2.1). The FTS Rider also provided that WSFS may reject any order that does not comply with the Services Agreement or funds transfer rules and security procedures. (Id., WSFS 01535-01536, FTS Rider ¶ 2.2).\nThe FTS Rider described the notice required if a payment order was not executed. If WSFS rejected or failed to execute an order of UDI, then WSFS was obligated to give notice to UDI by no later than the close of business on the execution date of the order. (Id.).\nSection 3 of the FTS Rider defined the fees, compensation, and costs associated for the services. The FTS Rider allowed WSFS to directly debit any of UDI’s accounts without prior notice for any fees, charge-backs, return fees for checks, drafts, payment orders or other payments owing to WSFS. (Id., WSFS 01537-01538, FTS Rider ¶ 3.1).\nWSFS was required to pay UDI if it rejected or failed to execute an order if, on the execution date of the order, there was a sufficient available balance in UDI’s account to pay for the order. (Id., WSFS 01538, FTS Rider ¶ 3.3). WSFS also was required to compensate UDI for the use of funds at the rate specified in ¶ 3.1.\nC. Discussion\nIn Count Three, the Trustee claims that WSFS intentionally failed to execute the First and Second TD Bank Transfer Orders with the intent of taking the funds, for its own benefit, (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 115, 118), giving rise to a claim under 6 Del. C. § 4A-305.\nWSFS raises several grounds for the entry of summary judgment in its favor on Count Three. First, WSFS argues that due to UDI’s material contract breach, WSFS had no obligation to execute the orders under the CMA, and therefore no liability under § 4A-305. (WSFS Mem. at 86). Second, WSFS contends that there is no dispute that WSFS actually executed the orders, but then reversed them. (Id. at 87). Lastly, WSFS argues that the FTS Rider gave WSFS discretion to execute the orders and UDI did not have sufficient collected available funds as required. (Id. at 86-87). WSFS’ second argument provides the rule of decision on Count Three.\nThe undisputed facts establish that WSFS executed the First and Second TD Bank Transfer Orders. TD Bank, the beneficiary bank in this transaction, accepted the orders and credited UMI’s account at TD Bank. The funds transfer was completed.\nIt is also undisputed that WSFS requested TD Bank to return the First and Second TD Bank Transfer Orders. TD Bank honored WSFS’ request that the First TD Bank Transfer Order be reversed, but refused the request as to the Second Transfer Order.\nThe Trustee’s claim fails because once a payment order is accepted it may not be rejected. By definition, neither Transfer Order was rejected.\nArticle 4A allows recovery under certain narrow circumstances. This fact situation before me does not fit the provisions of the statute. Further, a review of the case law, reveals no decision on point to support the Trustee’s legal theory. Therefore, the Trustee may not recover under Article 4A for a post-completion revocation of a completed payment order.\nTo the extent the Trustee complains about the revocation of the Second TD Bank Transfer Order, there is no remedy under Article 4A. I do not decide whether another provision of the U.C.C. provides a remedy or whether the transaction might state a cause of action under another area of state law. The Trustee has not raised an alternative cause of action.\nSummary judgment should be entered in favor of WSFS and against the Trustee on Count Three of the Second Amended Complaint.\nVIL WSFS IS ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE TRUSTEE’S FRAUDULENT TRANSFER CLAIMS (COUNTS SIX AND SEVEN)\nA. The Trustee’s Claims Are Based Solely on Constructive Fraud\nIn Count Six and Seven, the Trustee asserts claims for fraudulent transfers pursuant to 11-56-U.S.C. §§ 544 and 548. Although the Trustee recites the “actual intent” provisions of 6 Del. C. §§ 1804(a)(1) (for purposes of § 544) and 11 U.S.C. § 548(a)(1)(A), he has not presented any argument or evidence in support of a claim for intentional fraud. In these circumstances, I do not consider the Trustee to be pressing any claim that UMI, UDI or WSFS participated in any scheme that was intentionally designed to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. Therefore, I limit my analysis of Counts Six and Seven to the Trustee’ constructive fraud claim.\nB. Summaiy of the Parties’ Positions\nThe transfers at issue are the following: (1) the initial UMI-UDI Transfers and (2) the Setoff (ie., UDI’s involuntary transfer to WSFS that paid off the Loan). Collectively, I will refer them as the “Transfers.”\nThe Trustee offers two (2) legal theories that the Transfers were constructively fraudulent.\nFirst, the Trustee argues that the UMI-UDI Transfers went directly to WSFS. The Trustee contends that WSFS was the “initial transferee” because it exercised dominion and control over UDI’s depository accounts by placing the PND restriction on UDI’s accounts before taking the funds for its own benefit — even though the UMI-UDI Transfers were deposited initially into UDI’s account before WSFS moved the money to the general ledger account and subsequently satisfied the Loan. (Tr. Mem. at 78). The Trustee further emphasizes that WSFS controlled the disposition of other monies in the UDI Accounts, including reversing and returning items previously attempted to be paid out by UDI (ie., the Second TD Bank Transfer). (Tr. Mem. at 79). Under this initial transferee theory, the Trustee asserts that he may recover the Transfers because there was no consideration for the Transfers. There was no consideration because UMI owed no money to WSFS and WSFS provided no value to UMI (which was insolvent'at the time) in return for the $5 million that it received.\nThe Trustee’s alternative legal theory is that he may recover the Transfers from WSFS as a subsequent transferee. The basis for this position is quite conventional. He contends that UMI did not receive reasonably equivalent value for the transfers it made to UDI.\nWSFS disputes every aspect of the Trustee’s theory. As a threshold issue, WSFS argues that the Trustee has not identified the Transfers with specificity. Next, WSFS contends that not only was UDI the initial transferee, but also there was value supporting both the inbound transfers from UMI to UDI and the subsequent outbound transfers from UDI to WSFS (the consideration in the second transfer being repayment of an antecedent debt). Finally, WSFS contends that the Transfers made in satisfaction of UDI’s outstanding debt (¿a, the Loan) were in good faith and without knowledge of their avoidability. See 11 U.S.C. § 550(b)(1).\nC. Constructive Fraud: Applicable Legal Principles\n1. 11 U.S.C. § 548\nFor a constructive fraud claim, 11 U.S.C. § 548(a) provides:\n(a)(1) The trustee may avoid any transfer ... of an interest of the debt- or in property ... that was made ... within 2 years before the date of the filing of the petition, if the debtor voluntarily or involuntari-iy-\n* * *\n(B) (I) received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation; and\n(ii) (I) was insolvent on the date that such transfer was made or such obligation was incurred, or became insolvent as a result of such transfer or obligation;\n(II) was engaged in business or a transaction, or was about to engage in business or a transaction, for which any property remaining with the debtor was an unreasonably small capital;\n(III) intended to incur, or believed that the debtor would incur, debts that would be beyond the debtor’s ability to pay as such debts matured; or.\n(IV) made such transfer to or for the benefit of an insider, or incurred such obligation to or for the benefit of an insider, under an employment contract and not in the ordinary course of business.\nIn most proceedings, this constructive fraudulent transfer statutory verbiage can be distilled down to four (4) elements:\n(1) the debtor had an interest in the property;\n(2) the interest was transferred within two years of the filing of his bankruptcy petition;\n(3) the debtor received less than equivalent value in exchange for the transfer; and\n(4) either:\n(I) the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transfer; or\n(ii) became insolvent as a result thereof; or\n(iii) intended to incur, or believed that he would incur, debts that would be beyond his ability to pay them as they became matured.\nSee, e.g., In re Dawley, 2005 WL 2077074, at *14 (Bankr.E.D.Pa. Aug. 10, 2005).\nThe party challenging the transfer bears the burden of proving all of the elements of a constructive fraudulent transfer claim. See, e.g., In re Fruehauf Trailer Corp., 444 F.3d 203, 211 (3d Cir. 2006); In re Plassein Int’l Corp., 405 B.R. 402, 411 (Bankr.D.Del.2009), aff'd, 428 B.R. 64 (D.Del.2010).\nFrequently in § 548(a)(1)(B) litigation, the most heavily litigated issue is the third element: whether the debtor received reasonably equivalent value in the transaction. In this Circuit, courts employ a two (2) step process in determining whether a debtor received reasonably equivalent value in the form of indirect economic benefits in a particular transaction:\n(1) whether any value is received, and\n(2) whether that value was reasonably equivalent to the transfer made.\nIn re R.M.L., 92 F.3d 139, 152 (3d Cir.1996); Plassein Int’l Corp., 405 B.R. at 411; see also In re Fid. Bond & Mortg. Co., 340 B.R. 266, 287 (Bankr. E.D.Pa.2006), aff'd, 371 B.R. 708 (E.D.Pa. 2007). Because the purpose of the fraudulent transfer statute is to protect creditors, the court determines whether value was received from the vantage of the creditor. Fid. Bond & Mortg., 340.B.R. at 286. The inquiry is “what did the debtor give up and what did it receive that could benefit creditors.” Id. (citing In re Joy Recovery Tech. Corp., 286 B.R. 54, 75 (Bankr.N.D.Ill. 2002)).\nIn this determination, “value ... include[s] any benefit ... whether direct or indirect.” Fruehauf Trailer Corp., 444 F.3d at 212 (citation omitted); Mellon Bank, N.A. v. Metro Communications, Inc., 945 F.2d 635, 646-47 (3d Cir.1991); In re Vaso Active Pharm., Inc., 2012 WL 4793241 (Bankr.D.Del., Oct. 9, 2012). The' “touchstone” in the determination is whether the parties exchanged comparable “realizable commercial value.” Mellon Bank, 945 F.2d at 647. Thus, if a debtor’s “realizable going concern value after the transaction is equal to or exceeds its going concern value before the transaction, reasonably equivalent value has been received.” Id.\nIn the reasonably equivalent value inquiry, courts look to the totality of the circumstances, considering such factors as “(1) whether the transaction was at arm’s length, (2) whether the transferee acted in good faith, and (3) the degree of difference between the fair market value of the assets transferred and the price paid.” Plassein Int’l Corp., 405 B.R. at 411; accord Fid. Bond & Mortg., 340 B.R. at 287 (citing R.M.L., 92 F.3d at 145, 153). If a court concludes that the benefits the debtor received “are minimal and certainly not equivalent to the value of a substantial outlay of assets,” a plaintiff need not prove the exact value conferred because the “amount” of value is then irrelevant. Fruehauf Trailer Corp., 444 F.3d at 214.\n2. 11 U.S.C. § 544(b) and 6 Del. C. §§ 1304, 1305\n11 U.S.C. § 544(b)(1) provides that “the trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable under applicable law by a creditor holding an unsecured claim that is allowable under section 502.... ” Section 544(b) allows the Trustee to step into the shoes of an actual creditor who existed at the commencement of the bankruptcy case, and avoid the fraudulent transfers pursuant to state law.\nThe Trustee invokes 6 Del. C. §§ 1304 and 1305 of the Delaware fraudulent transfer statute as applicable state law under § 544(b).\n6 Del. C. § 1304 provides:\n(a) A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor, whether the creditor’s claim arose before or after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation: * * *\n(2) Without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation, and the debt- or:\na. Was engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction; or\nb. Intended to incur, or believed or reasonably should have believed that the debtor would incur, debts beyond the debtor’s ability to pay as they became due.\n6 Del. C. § 1305 provides:\n(a) A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor whose claim arose before the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation and the debtor was insolvent at that time or the debtor became insolvent as a result of the transfer or obligation.\n(b) A transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor whose claim arose before the transfer was made if the transfer was made to an insider for an antecedent debt, the ■ debtor was insolvent at that time and the insider had reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent.\nIn order to prevail under the Delaware constructive fraud transfer provisions, the Trustee must establish that:\n(1) the debtor made a transfer;\n(2) for less than reasonably equivalent value; and\n(3) the debtor was, or was rendered^ insolvent thereby.\nIn re Delta Petroleum Corp., 2015 WL 1577990, *18 (Bankr.D.Del. Apr. 2, 2015) (citing Brandt v. Trivest II, Inc. (In re Plassein Int'l Corp.), 2008 WL 1990315, *5 (Bankr.D.Del. May 5, 2008)).\nD. WSFS Was Not an “Initial Transferee” of the UMI Transfers\nThe Trustee’s lead theory hinges on the notion that WSFS was the initial transferee (i.e., the direct recipient) of the UMI-UDI Transfers.\nSignificantly, the concept of an “initial transferee” does not derive from the avoidance sections of the Bankruptcy Code. Rather, it is derived from 11 U.S.C. § 550, the Code provision that addresses a trustee’s ability to recover property after establishing that a transfer is avoidable. Section 550 of the Code provides, in pertinent part:\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, to the extent that a transfer is avoided under section 544, 545, 547, 548, 549, 553(b), or 724(a) of this title, the trustee may recover, for the benefit of the estate, the property transferred, or, if the court so orders, the value of such property, from—\n(1) the initial transferee of such transfer or the entity for whose benefit such transfer was made; or\n(2) an immediate or mediate transferee of such initial transferee.\n11 U.S.C. § 550(a).\nSection 550(a) does not define the term “initial transferee,” however. In the absence of a clear statutory definition, courts have developed standards for determining whether a party is an “initial transferee.”\n1. The Bonded Financial Services and Incomnet Tests\nMost courts, including a number of circuit courts of appeal, have concluded that mere initial receipt of a transfer does not always equate to initial transferee status. See 4 Norton Bankr.L. & Prac. 3d § 70:2 (West 2015).\nIn Bonded Fin. Servs. v. European Am. Bank., 838 F.2d 890, 893 (7th Cir.1988) (emphasis added), the court explained:\nAlthough the Bankruptcy Code does not define “transferee,” and there is no legislative history on the point, we think the minimum requirement of status as a “transferee” is dominion over the money or other asset, the right to put the money to one’s own purposes.\nThe standard articulated in Bonded is known as the “dominion-and-control test,” and has been widely adopted. See In re Hurtado, 342 F.3d 528, 533 (6th Cir.2003) (following In re Finley, Rumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson & Casey, 130 F.3d 52, 57 (2d Cir.1997)).\nIn In re Incomnet, Inc., 463 F.3d 1064 (9th Cir.2006), the Ninth Circuit articulated a distinction between “dominion” and “control.” The focus of the dominion standard is “whether an entity had legal authority over the money and the right to use the money however it wished.” Id. at 1070. The transferee has dominion if it has “the right to put the money to one’s own purposes.” Id. (internal quotations and citation omitted). In contrast, the “control” standard may involve a broader, more flexible approach, in which the courts look at the entire transaction as a whole to evaluate which party truly had control of the money. Id.\nThe Incomnet court described the two (2) tests as “similar, [but] not indistinguishable.” Id. at 1071. The dominion test focuses on legal title and the transferee’s right to use the funds as it sees fit; the control test “takes a more gestalt view of the entire transaction to determine who ... controlled the funds in question.” Id\nAfter articulating the distinction between “dominion” and “control,” the In-comnet court clarified that, in prior cases, the Ninth Circuit had adopted the dominion test to the exclusion of the control test. Id. at 1071 (citing In re Cohen, 300 F.3d 1097, 1102 n. 2 (9th Cir.2002)); see also In re Mortgage Store, Inc., 773 F.3d 990, 996 (9th Cir.2014) (reaffirming the “dominion” test articulated by Incomnet).\nThe Third Circuit has not adopted any specific test. The parties differ as to the proper test the court should employ to evaluate this issue.\nThe Trustee argues that this court should employ the combined “dominion and control test,” set forth in Bonded Financial and focus on the transferee’s relationship to the property. (Tr. Mem. at 74 (citing Perrino v. Salem, Inc., 243 B.R. 550, 561 (D.Me.1999)). In other words, in the case of funds held in an account, the Trustee urges the court to determine' the terms under which the funds are held and to ascertain the debtor’s interest in said funds. “Funds may not be the-property of the party in whose account such funds reside, if such depositor’s use of those funds is so restricted that he cannot control their use or disposition.” (Tr. Mem. at 74-75 (citing In re Bank of New Eng., 165 B.R. 972, 977 (Bankr.D.Mass.1994))).\nWSFS views both the facts and the law differently. WSFS recommends application of the “dominion” test, as set forth by Incomnet. WSFS argues that it never exercised dominion over the transfers from UMI (and, thus, cannot be an initial transferee) because it had no legal right to use those funds. WSFS describes the PND restriction as merely “a privileged cautionary measure [that] limited [WSFS’] discretionary provision of credit to UDI under the Cash Management Services Agreement.” (WSFS Mem. at 119; Doc. # 206). Citing to Citizens Bank of Maryland v. Strumpf 516 U.S. 16, 116 S.Ct. 286, 133 L.Ed.2d 258 (1995), WSFS claims that such an act of temporary suspension is not an act of dominion. (WSFS Mem. at 120). “Suspension is not even denial of any level of control of the funds, since WSFS’s obligations to UDI were not denied — merely frozen to protect them from the automatic debits in the electronic funds transfer system.” (Id.). As to the $5 million applied to satisfy UDI’s loan, WSFS characterizes this as a subsequent transaction; simply a transfer from the UDI deposit account to a ledger account, with WSFS’s $5 million obligation to UDI as a deposit customer remaining intact. Accordingly, WSFS argues that UDI was the initial transferee when it received the funds from UMI, and took title and dominion over them. Only after UDI had dominion over those funds, did WSFS exercise its right to apply the funds to UDI’s Loan indebtedness. Thus, according to WSFS, WSFS was only a subsequent transferee of the UMI-UDI Transfer, not the initial transferee from UMI.\n2. WSFS was not the initial transferee because it lacked dominion or control over the UDI accounts\nBased on my review of the record, I agree with WSFS and conclude that the undisputed facts establish that WSFS lacked dominion or control over the UDI accounts sufficient to establish that WSFS was an initial transferee under § 550(a). Contrary to the picture drawn by the Trustee, the measures taken by WSFS between July 16 through July 19, 2009 did not absolutely restrict all outgoing transfers from UDI’s account.\nMost significantly, there is no evidence of any legal title change to the funds in UDI’s accounts. Nor is there any indication that UDI was utterly helpless and without access to funds. As detailed in Part V.B., supra, for the few days the PND was in effect, WSFS continued to honor requests for transfers and otherwise made funds availablé to UDI. The PND merely suspended the funding of outgoing transfers with provisional or advance credit without review.\nTherefore, I conclude that WSFS did not have the requisite dominion or control over UDI’s accounts to render it an “initial transferee” of the UMI-UDI Transfers. WSFS was a subsequent transferee.\nE. WSFS Is Not Liable as a Subsequent Transferee of the UMI-UDI Transfer\nHaving determined that WSFS was a subsequent transferee of the UMI-UDI Transfers, I now must evaluate the corollary issue: whether, as a result of the Setoff, WSFS was the recipient of a fraudulent transfer as a subsequent transferee.\nIn this scenario, the Trustee must establish that UMI did not receive reasonably equivalent value for the transfers UMI made to UDI and that WSFS is liable as a subsequent transferee. See II U.S.C. §§ 548(a)(1)(B) and 550(a)(2). For the following reasons, I find the Trustee has not met his burden his burden of proof.\nThe Trustee argues that UMI received no value for the transfers they made to UDI because UMI provided goods and services to UDI—ie., there was no reason for UMI to transfer money to UDI. (Tr. at 68, n.27; Tr. Reply at 30-31). The Trustee posits that the funds should have flowed the other direction, ie., from UDI to UMI. (Tr. Mem. at 68, n.27). As WSFS points out, however, it was the Trustee’s burden to produce evidence demonstrating the lack of reasonably equivalent value. The Trustee has failed to submit any evidence other than his supposition that UDI did not provide value to UMI.\nMoreover, in pressing for summary judgment, WSFS has not relied solely on the shortfall in the Trustee’s case. WSFS also offered evidence that the Transfers were made in exchange for value. WSFS documented $1.7 million of UDI credit card sale receivables that UMI collected during July 2009 and owed to UDI. Further value to UMI and UEI was provided in the form of liquidity obtained through the cash management services WSFS provided to UDI. (WSFS Reply at 28). WSFS also offered evidence that UMI owed an obligation to UDI on account of receivables it was collecting on UDI’s behalf. (See Ex. 76, Bohnert Dep. at 185-86).\nThe Trustee has not quantified the inadequacy of any value UDI received from UMI, as is his burden. The only evidence in the summary judgment record is that the UMI-UDI Transfers were supported by some value. Thus, the Trustee lacks evidentiary support for a necessary element of his claim. In these circumstances, WSFS is entitled to summary judgment on this claim. See Polichuk, 506 B.R. at 423 (“the appropriate time for demonstrating that there is evidence that supports every element of ... the Trustee’s claims (in response to the contention that no such evidence exists) is now, at summary judgment”) (internal quotations omitted).\nVIII. WSFS IS NOT ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE TRUSTEE’S SETOFF CLAIM UNDER 11 U.S.C. § 553(b) (COUNT EIGHT)\nA. The Trustee’s § 553(b) Claim is Dependent on the Nunc Pro Tunc Extension of Substantive Consolidation to WSFS\nIn Count Eight, the Trustee invokes 11 U.S.C. §§ 553(b) and 550 and seeks to avoid WSFS’ $5 million Setoff against UDI’s bank accounts.\nSection § 553(b) provides:\n(b)(1) Except with respect to a setoff of a kind described in section 362(b)(6), 362(b)(7), 862(b)(17), 362(b)(27), 555, 556, 559, 560, 561, 365(h), 546(h), or 365(i)(2) of this title, if a creditor offsets a mutual debt owing to the debtor against a claim against the debtor on or within 90 days before the date of the filing of the petition, then the .trustee may recover from such creditor the amount so offset to the extent that any insufficiency on the date of such setoff is less than the insufficiency on the later of—\n(A) 90 days before the date of the filing of the petition; and\n(B) the first date during the 90 days immediately preceding the date of the filing of the petition on which there is an insufficiency.\n(2) In this subsection, “insufficiency” means amount, if any, by which a claim against the debtor exceeds a mutual debt owing to the debtor by the holder of such claim.'\n11 U.S.C. § 553(b).\nSection 553 allows a trustee to avoid the amount of its improvement in position within 90 days of the petition date. The mechanics of determining whether a creditor improved its position by setoff during the 90 day period is as follows:\n[WJhere a setoff occurred within 90 days before the commencement of bankruptcy, the trustee ... may recover the amount of setoff to the extent of a reduction of the insufficiency within a certain time frame. “Insufficiency” is defined at § 553(b)(2) as the amount by which a claim against a debtor exceeds a mutual debt owing to the debtor by the holder of such claim. Under § 553(b), the amount [of] the setoff [that] may be recovered is determined by comparing the insufficiency in existence 90 days before the filing (or, if later, the first date on which there was an insufficiency) with the insufficiency on the date of setoff. The trustee ... is entitled to recover the amount by which the former amount exceeds the latter.\nIn re Aspen Data Graphics, Inc., 109 B.R. 677, 684 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1990) (citations omitted).\nNinety (90) days prior to the setoff, the Trustee contends that there was an “insufficiency” in excess of $5.75 million. (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 218). On the day that WSFS setoff the Loan, there was no insufficiency; the setoff paid off the indebtedness.\nThe Trustee’s § 553(b) claim is dependent upon achieving substantive consolidation of UDI’s estate with the existing bankruptcy estate as to WSFS. As explained in Part III.A., supra, the court’s order substantively consolidating UMI and UDI provided that the order would not “impact any rights concerning WSFS,” thereby excepting WSFS from its effects. As to WSFS, the order provided that UDI would be treated as having filed a bankruptcy petition on August 4, 2010 in a case jointly administered (but not substantively consolidated) with UMI’s bankruptcy case.\nIf August 4, 2010 is employed as the petition date, the Trustee’s claim is doomed because WSFS’ July 2009 setoff occurred far outside the ninety (90) day look back period of 11 U.S.C. § 553(b)(1)(A). Hence, in this adversary proceeding, the Trustee invokes the right reserved in the August 4, 2010 substantive consolidation order to seek extension of substantive consolidation to WSFS effective July 23, 2009 (the date UMI filed its bankruptcy petition). If UDI is treated as having filed a bankruptcy petition on July 23, 2009, the Trustee can satisfy the temporal ninety (90) day requirement m § 553(b).\nIn their memoranda, the parties sparred on the threshold issue whether, as a matter of law, the Trustee may even seek substantive consolidation as to WSFS.\nWSFS argues that the Trustee may not wield substantive consolidation offensively, i. e., as a stratagem to create a § 553(b) claim against WSFS. (WSFS Mem. at 88). WSFS relies on Owens Coming, 419 F.3d 195 (3d Cir.2005), and asserts that substantive consolidation cannot be used to create causes of action to the detriment of creditors or to alter creditors’ rights. WSFS also makes a more fact-specific based argument that it is being “singled out” by the Trustee and that such use of substantive consolidation is inappropriate and impermissible.\nThe Trustee responds that he is not singling out WSFS. The Trustee states that one aspect of the goal of substantive consolidation is to allow the estate to bring actions on behalf of the consolidated estates in order to bring assets back into the estate and for the benefit all creditors. The Trustee asserts that, from the outset, he sought substantive consolidation to create avoidance actions and raise an estate with the consolidated entities and that he merely deferred resolution of the issue as to WSFS.\nOn this threshold issue, the Trustee is correct.\nB. Substantive Consolidation: General Legal Principles\nSubstantive consolidation is an equitable remedy. “It treats separate legal entities as if they were' merged into a single survivor left with all the cumulative assets and liabilities (save for inter-entity liabilities, which are erased).” Owens Corning, 419 F.3d at 205 (quoting In re Genesis Health Ventures, Inc., 402 F.3d 416, 423 (3d Cir.2005)). The Third Circuit has described substantive consolidation as an “extreme” and “last-resort remedy” that “rais[es] the specter for some [creditors] of a significant distribution diminution.” Owens Corning, 419 F.3d at 206.\nOwens Coming created a black letter law test for substantive consolidation in which the proponent must prove: “(i) pre-petition [the entities to be consolidated] disregarded separateness so significantly their creditors relied on the breakdown of entity borders and treated them as one legal entity, or (ii) postpetition their assets and liabilities are so scrambled that separating them is prohibitive and hurts all creditors.” Id. at 211 (footnotes omitted).\nThe black letter law test is stated in general terms, leaving much to the exercise of the bankruptcy court’s discretion. The Owens court sought to guide the bankruptcy court by stating the following limiting principles to be considered when a party seeks substantive consolidation:\n(1) Absent compelling circumstances, state law, the Bankruptcy Code and commercial markets legitimately expect courts to respect the separateness of separate entities.\n(2) The harms that substantive consolidation addresses are nearly always those caused by debtors who disregard separateness.\n(3) Mere benefit to the administration of the case is not a harm that justifies substantive consolidation.\n(4) Substantive consolidation is extreme and imprecise — this rough justice should be rare and used as a last resort.\n(5) “While substantive consolidation may be used defensively to remedy the identifiable' harms caused by entangled affairs, it may not be used offensively (for example, having a primary purpose to disadvantage tactically a group of creditors in the plan process or to alter creditor rights).”\nOwens Corning, 419 F.3d at 211.\nIt is the fifth legal principle quoted above that is the foundation of WSFS’ argument that extending substantive consolidation to it, at this time, is inappropriate. Respectfully, I disagree that the fifth legal principle controls the outcome here.\nC. Owens Corning Does Not Bar, As a Matter of Law, the Nunc Pro Tunc Extension of Substantive Consolidation to WSFS\nWSFS argues that I should consider the propriety of extending the substantive consolidation from the vantage point of July 18, 2011, the date the Trustee filed this adversary proceeding. Certainly, as of that date, WSFS can make a strong case that the Trustee’s request for substantive consolidation appears inconsistent with Owens Coming. It has the appearance of a litigation tool targeting a single creditor, rather than as a remedy designed to do equity among numerous parties. However, this argument fails to take into account the prior procedural history of this case.\nThe Trustee’s original motion for substantive consolidation encompassed WSFS. In the consolidation motion, the Trustee represented that a significant magnitude of inter-company transfers among the Affiliates occurred on a daily basis; assets of the companies were commingled; business records could not be reconciled without substantial expense; and certain large creditors relied upon the overall financial position of UMI effectively as a single entity. The factual circumstances alleged by the Trustee provided a facially plausible justification for substantive consolidation under Owens Coming.\nFurther, from the outset, the Trustee sought nunc pro tunc consolidation as a means to preserve claims under chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Trustee represented that the chapter 5 claims “would otherwise be unavailable as a potential avenue of recovery by the creditor body of the Universal Network” and that preservation alone “would clearly provide significant benefit to the creditors of the consolidated Universal Network entities.” (Goldstein Declaration ¶ 15; Bky No. 09-15404, Doc. # 318). The Trustee was not seeking to isolate an individual creditor or a discreet group for disparate treatment; instead, he was suggesting that the universe of transfer avoidance claims was a tool that should be available for the equitable administration of this chapter 7 case.\nAgainst this backdrop, no creditor objected to the Trustee’s substantive consolidation request except WSFS. The Trustee and WSFS then struck the bargain described earlier in this Opinion, in which substantive consolidation was effected (except for WSFS), UDI was deemed a jointly administered chapter 7 debtor as to WSFS as of August 4, 2010, and the parties reserved all of their respective rights to seek or contest further substantive consolidation. Presumably, the Trustee desired more time to investigate and weigh his options before embarking on what promised to be (and turned out to be) hotly contested, expensive litigation against WSFS. For its part, WSFS presumably hoped to avoid expending further resources litigating substantive consolidation issues that would be merely academic (as to WSFS) if the Trustee decided against filing adversary litigation against WSFS.\nIn effect, the parties’ agreed to defer the substantive consolidation dispute through a “standstill agreement.” To give effect to the parties’ agreement, it is necessary to treat this litigation as resuming the dispute when they declared a truce in August 2010. It follows that the issue should be considered as if no substantive consolidation had occurred as to any of the non-UMI entities. Thus, if the Trustee can make out the case now that would have allowed him to obtain substantive consolidation over WSFS’ objection as to all creditors (in 2010), he should be permitted to do so. To conclude otherwise would mean that, by obtaining substantive consolidation except as to WSFS in 2010, the Trustee did not preserve, but rather effectively waived, his right to later seek extension of substantive consolidation retroactive to July 23, 2009 as to WSFS. The parties’ agreement, as incorporated in the August 4, 2010 substantive consolidation order, is to the contrary.\nIn these circumstances, the parties’ agreement and fairness dictate that I now consider the extension of nunc pro tunc substantive consolidation to WSFS from the pre-substantive consolidation temporal vantage point of August 4, 2010. Accord In re Lower Bucks Hospital, 471 B.R. 419, 450 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.2012), aff'd, 488 B.R. 303 (E.D.Pa.2013), aff'd, 571 Fed.Appx. 139 (3d Cir.2014) (parties bound by agreement to allow chapter 11 plan to be confirmed and defer litigation of propriety and court approval of discreet plan provision without prejudice to their rights). It follows that WSFS’ argument that the extension of substantive consolidation constitutes an inappropriate “offensive” use of the doctrine is unpersuasive.\nIn sum, based on the particular circumstances of this case, I conclude that: (1) the Trustee’s request for nunc pro tunc extension of substantive consolidation as to WSFS should be considered on its merits, and (2) therefore, the Trustee’s setoff claim is not barred as a matter of law for failure to satisfy the ninety (90) day look back requirement of 11 U.S.C. § 553(b)(1)(A).\nD. The Setoff Claim is Not Ripe for Summary Judgment\nOther than debating the issue whether an attempted “offensive” use of substantive consolidation to create an avoidance claim against a single creditor barred its applicability in this case as a matter of law (thereby defeating the Trustee’s § 553(b) setoff claim), neither party discussed or marshaled the evidence generated in discovery on the questions whether the Trustee has or lacks evidence to support (1) substantive consolidation under Owens Coming and (2) the elements of a setoff claim under § 553(b) — in particular, whether the “insufficiency” decreased during the ninety (90) day period prior to the bankruptcy filing. In these circumstances, summary judgment on the Trustee’s setoff claim should not be granted because there are disputed issues of material fact.\nIX. MANNER OF DISPOSITION OF THE MOTIONS\nFor the reasons explained below, I cannot enter a final, dispositive order granting summary judgment to WSFS on Counts One, Two, Three, Six and Seven.\nA. Jurisdictional Overview\nAs stated in numerous reported opinions, bankruptcy subject matter jurisdiction is conferred by 28 U.S.C. § 1334(a) and (b) potentially extends to four (4) types of title 11 matters:\n(1) cases under title 11;\n(2) proceedings arising under title 11;\n(3) proceedings arising in a case under title 11; and\n(4) proceedings related to a case under title 11.\nSee, e.g., In re Combustion Engineering, Inc., 391 F.3d 190, 225-26 (3d Cir.2004). This jurisdiction is vested in the district court, but the district court has the authority to refer bankruptcy cases and proceedings to the bankruptcy court. 28 U.S.C. § 157(a). In this district, the district court has done so. See Standing Orders of the District Court dated July 25, 1984 and November 8,1990.\nAccording to the text of the Judicial Code, all bankruptcy matters, other than the bankruptcy case itself, may be classified into two (2) categories:\n(1) core proceedings arising under title 11; and\n(2) non-core proceedings that are otherwise related to a case under title 11.\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 157(b), (c); In re Mullarkey, 536 F.3d 215, 221 (3d Cir.2008).\nThe core/non-core distinction is significant because “[a] correct determination of whether a matter is core or non-core establishes the bankruptcy judge’s level of authority.” In re Seven Fields Dev. Corp., 505 F.3d 237, 254 (3d Cir.2007). The bankruptcy court has the statutory authority to determine all core matters. 11 U.S.C. § 157(b)(1); see generally In re Porter, 295 B.R. 529, 535 (Bankr.E.D.Pa. 2003). In a non-core proceeding, the bankruptcy court may not enter a final judgment, but may only submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court for de novo review, unless all parties agree that a final judgment may be entered by the bankruptcy court. See 28 U.S.C. § 157(c); Halper v. Halper, 164 F.3d 830, 836 (3d Cir.1999).\nIn 2011, the Supreme Court’s decision in Stem v. Marshall, created a third category of matters in the universe governing the division of authority between the district court and the bankruptcy court. In Stem, the Supreme Court held that Article III of the U.S. Constitution prohibits bankruptcy courts from issuing final orders in certain matters Congress classified as core in 28 U.S.C. § 157(b). Such claims (commonly referred to as “Stem” claims) are now treated in most, if not all, respects as non-core. See Wellness Int’l Network, — U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1932, 191 L.Ed.2d 911.\nThus, to determine the scope of its decision-making authority, the bankruptcy court must now undertake a two-step process. First, as it did prior to Stem, it must ascertain whether 28 U.S.C. § 157(b) designates a particular claim as core or non-core. Second, if the court determines the claim to be core (statutorily speaking), the court then must consider whether the claim is a Stem claim.\nIn this case, the Trustee has asserted that all of his claims are core. (Second Am. Compl. ¶3, Adv. No. 11-512, Doc. # 170). WSFS disputes this. (Answer to Second Am. Compl. ¶ 3, Adv. No. 11-512, Doc. # 176).\nB. All of the Claims to Be Dismissed are Either Non-Core or Stern Claims\nThe concept of a core proceeding is anchored in two (2) of the jurisdictional bases stated in 28 U.S.C. § 1334(b) for the exercise of bankruptcy jurisdiction. “[C]ore proceedings consist of two subsets: those that ‘arise under’ and those that ‘arise in’ the bankruptcy case.” Porter, 295 B.R. at 535. At bottom, “[c]ore proceedings represent those disputes that are so intertwined with the bankruptcy process that Congress has the power, under Article I of the Constitution, to direct a non-tenured judicial officer (i.e., bankruptcy judge) to render a final determination of their merits. Id.\nThe Court of Appeals has provided guidance for the determination whether a claim is core or non-core.\nIf the proceeding involves a right created by the federal bankruptcy law, it is a core proceeding; for example, an action by the trustee to avoid a preference. If the proceeding is one that would arise only in bankruptcy, it is also a core proceeding; for example, the filing of a proof of claim or an objection to the discharge of a particular debt. If the proceeding does not invoke a substantive right created by the federal bankruptcy law and is one that could exist outside of bankruptcy it is not a core proceeding; it may be related to the bankruptcy because of its potential effect, but under section 157(c)(1) it is an “otherwise related” or non-core proceeding.\nIn re Guild and Gallery Plus, Inc., 72 F.3d 1171, 1178 (3d Cir.1996) (quoting In re Wood, 825 F.2d 90, 97 (5th Cir.1987)); accord In re Exide Technologies, 544 F.3d 196, 206 (3d Cir.2008); Halper, 164 F.3d at 836. Of course, as part of the process of applying these principles, the bankruptcy court must consult the illustrative examples of core proceedings set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 157(b). See Exide Technologies, 544 F.3d at 206.\nNo extended discussion is necessary to explain why the Trustee’s first three (3) claims are non-core. These claims — (a) in contract, for breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, (b) for breach of contract, and (c) for violation of 6 Del. C. § 4A-305)—are not found in 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2) or title 11 of the U.S.Code. They all are grounded in applicable non-bankruptcy law and exist independently of any bankruptcy filing.\nThe remaining two (2) claims subject to dismissal (Counts Six and Seven) are fraudulent transfer claims. Congress has classified such claims as core proceedings. See 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(H). However, it also is necessary to evaluate whether they are Stem claims.\nThe reported opinions discussing whether a bankruptcy court has the constitutional authority to enter a final judgment in a fraudulent transfer action brought pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 544 or 548 are legion. See Construction and Application of United States Supreme Court Decision in Stern v. Marshall, 77 A.L.R. Fed. 2d 23, §§ 23-24 (West 2015). I will not burden this Opinion with a lengthy analysis of the issue. Suffice it to say that I agree with the court’s reasoning in In re InCl Auction & Appraisal Servs. LLC, 493 B.R. 460, 464-65 (Bankr.M.D.Pa.2013). In Int'l Auction, the court held that the Supreme Court’s rationale in Stem, when combined with the Court’s prior holding that the right to recover fraudulent transfers is a “private right,” not a “public right,” see Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 109 S.Ct. 2782, 106 L.Ed.2d 26 (1989), compels the conclusion that the bankruptcy court lacks the authority to enter a final judgment in such matters.\nIn this bankruptcy case, where WSFS has not filed a proof of claim, and therefore resolution of the Trustee’s fraudulent transfer claims can have no impact on the court’s core function of allowing and disallowing claims against the bankruptcy estate, see Stern, 131 S.Ct. at 2616-17, this court lacks the authority to enter a final order with respect to those claims.\nC. The Limited Nature of this Court’s Order Resolving the Cross-Motions\nHaving determined that WSFS’ summary judgment motion should be granted, but that the bankruptcy court may not enter a final order dismissing Counts One, Two, Three, Six and Seven, what is the appropriate disposition of WSFS’ motion?\nThe issue is complicated by the fact that one (1) claim—Count Eight (11 U.S.C. § 553)—has survived summary judgment. Had I concluded that WSFS was entitled to summary judgment on all of the Trustee’s claims, I simply could have issued a report and recommendation to the district court for appropriate disposition of all of the Trustee’s claims. However, because the district court referred this adversary proceeding to this court and the proceeding has not concluded, it would be premature for the bankruptcy court to issue a report and recommendation to the district recommending dismissal of some, but not all, of the Trustee’s claims. Doing so would be the functional equivalent of permitting an interlocutory appeal of an order dismissing some, but not all, of a plaintiffs claims, in a proceeding in which the bankruptcy court has the authority to enter a final judgment. By analogy, that would run afoul of the strong policy against piecemeal appeals. See generally In re G-I Holdings, Inc., 2005 WL 3370020, at *5 (D.N.J. Dec. 9, 2005); see also Gold v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 723 F.2d 1068, 1072 (3d Cir.1983) (discussing sparing use of collateral order doctrine).\nMy solution to the problem is to issue an order that dismisses the Trustee’s claims (save Count Eight) for purposes of trial of this adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court. At the conclusion of the adversary proceeding in this court, I will issue a comprehensive Report and Recommendation to the district court for the entry of an appropriate order with respect to all of those claims in the proceeding as to which the bankruptcy court lacks authority to enter a final judgment. See In re Drauschak, 481 B.R. 330, 339 (Bankr. E.D.Pa.2012) (“when an adversary proceeding raises multiple claims, the various claims must be analyzed for bankruptcy jurisdictional purposes on a claim-by-claim basis” (citing Halper, 164 F.3d at 839)).\nX. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, I will deny the Trustee’s motion for summary judgment and grant WSFS’ motion for summary judgment in part by dismissing; for purposes of trial in the bankruptcy court Counts One, Two, Three, Six and Seven. Count Eight survives summary judgment and will proceed toward trial. An appropriate order follows.\nORDER\nAND NOW, upon consideration of the Trustee’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Defendant WSFS’ Cross Motion for Summary Judgment, and the parties’ accompanying memoranda of law in support of the respective Motions, and for the reasons set forth in the accompanying Opinion,\nIt is hereby ORDERED that:\n1. Counts One, Two, Three, Six and Seven are DISMISSED for purposes of trial in the bankruptcy court, subject to de novo review by the district court.\n2. WSFS’ Cross Motion is DENIED as to Count Eight.\nA status conference is SCHEDULED on December 9, 2015, at 10:00 a.m., in Bankruptcy Courtroom No. 1, 2d floor, U.S. Courthouse, 900 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA.\n.

UMI’s corporate secretary described the flow of money within the Universal Network as follows:\nTypically, accounts were structured at a given bank so that each of the SPEs maintained a checking account, into which collections from the corresponding Station would be deposited (the “SPE Accounts”). ... [A]t the end of each day, the SPE Accounts were \""swept\"" into a “master account\"" generally in the name of Universal Delaware. In other words, the SPE Accounts were set up to be “zero balance” ... accounts.\nCash needs of the Universal Network members were met by funding a given entity whenever it needed funds on hand, from whatever source was available — i.e., credit lines, inter-company \""loans,” or any other source. Money was constantly flowing to and from the various entities (including [UMI] and Affiliates) in the form of inter-company transfers. These inter-company transfers were made on a daily basis between and among [UMI] and the Affiliates, and were effected primarily for the purpose of maintaining liquidity where it was needed in the Universal Network at any given point in time. Moreover, the entities did not maintain formal records of these inter-company transfers — as “loans” or otherwise — beyond the bank statements themselves.\nThe magnitude of the inter-company transfers, on any given day, could amount to hundreds of thousands, and at times, millions, of dollars being shifted among the [UMI’s] and the Affiliates’ various bank accounts.\n(Declaration of Jashveer Singh; Bky. No. 09-15404, Doc. #319) (emphasis added). This affidavit was filed in April 2010 in connection with a contested matter in the main bankruptcy case.\n. The degree to which WSFS restricted transfers out of UDI's accounts is material to the outcome of this adversary proceeding and is discussed in Parts V. and VIL, infra.\n. When appropriate, citations to the record will include a reference to specific pages using Bate Stamp numbers.\n. Initially, Foley proposed a $4 million demand line on January 8, 2009. (Ex. W-35, WSFS 06108). The proposal was revised to $5 million on January 14, 2009. (Ex. W-36, WSFS 00653).\n. The Credit Memorandum explained the origin of UDI, its existence as a business operator of 36 retail gas stations and convenience stores, its relationship as a wholesale purchaser of motor fuel from UEI and the 100% ownership of UDI and UEI by Daniel Singh in both single name ownership and various family trusts. It also clarified, with respect to UEI, that “[a]lthough financial statements were not provided for this company, D & B reports annual sales of $185MM and profits of $5.0MM in 2006.” (Ex. W-31, WSFS 00528). This reference to UEI was a clerical error and was meant to refer to UMI. (Ex. W-28, Foley 2004 Examination at 54). WSFS corrected the erroneous reference to UEI in a subsequent credit request package made in June 2009, when UDI requested an additional loan of $2.1 million, which WSFS denied. (Ex. W-40, WSFS 00550).\n.Foley further explained: “We were looking at making a loan to Universal Delaware, Inc., which was a retailer of oil fuel. It didn't matter whether Universal Delaware, Inc. was buying from Universal Marketing, Inc. or some other wholesaler, they would have continued to operated just as successfully.” (Ex. W-28, Foley 2004 Exam, at 56).\n. The representations were set forth is several subsections of the BLA. Some were under the heading “Conditions” (id., WSFS 00529-00260, BLA UK 2.1-2.2), some were under the heading “Representations and Warranties” (id., WSFS 00260-00261, BLA ¶¶ 3.1-3.2), and some were under the heading \""Covenants,” (id., WSFS 00263-00266, ¶¶4.1-4.2).\n. The CMA appears to be a boiler plate type of agreement whereby the borrower checks off boxes for the desired cash management services it desires from WSFS. UMI elected seven (7) services:\n• ACH Debit Block/Filter;\n• Credit & Investment Sweep;\n• Business Internet Banking;\n• Positive Pay;\n• Funds Transfer;\n• Xpress Deposit;\n• Zero Balance Account.\n(Id., WSFS 01533).\n. The CMA stated that it was subject to the \""General Terms and Conditions Applicable to Cash Management Services” (\""the General Terms and Conditions Attachment”) \""set forth after the signatures below” and any terms and conditions set forth in any rider, any exhibit or schedule to a rider, any addendum or modification that may be executed by the parties. (Id., WSFS 01533).\nIn discovery, WSFS produced a seven (7) page General Terms and Conditions Attachment. It provided that either party could terminate its obligations under the CMA on thirty (30) days notice. (Id., WSFS 01296, CMA Attachment ¶ 8(a)). But it also allowed WSFS to terminate the CMA immediately with or without prior notice in twelve (12) enumerated situations, including:\n• if \""any representation made or information provided by a Customer Party is false or misleading in any material respect when made or provided,” (id. ¶ 8(a)(viii);\n• upon “Customer’s] ... fail[ure] to comply with any of its obligations under these Terms or any one or more Service Agreements,” (id.) ¶ 8(a)(1);\n• WSFS, in its sole discretion, believing that its provision of any Service created a risk of financial loss for it, (id. ¶ 8(b)).\nThese provisions are important insofar as the Trustee’s claims are based, in part, on the lack of prior notice before WSFS exercised certain default remedies.\nSignificantly, however, the existence and authenticity of the General Terms and Conditions Attachment is in dispute. WSFS did not produce the General Terms and Conditions Attachment until the last day of discovery, alleging that it found the document belatedly on an internal computer drive. The Trustee considers these circumstances suspicious and disputes the authenticity of the document.\nI have not relied on the General Terms and Conditions Attachment in ruling on the pending motions.\n. Kocher testified that before approving additional credit facilities to UDI, he felt he needed more information as to how UDI used the existing credit facility. (Ex. W-37, Koch-er Dep. at 45-46). Kocher explained:\nIt specifically had to do with the use of our line of credit and the activity of that line given the nature of Universal Delaware's business. Universal Delaware’s business was portrayed as a retail operation that did not own the real estate, did not have much in terms of capital improvements or capital assets, and they consumed five million dollars in working capital in a business that is primarily cash driven and doesn't have a significant amount of inventory. That’s a lot of working capital. I believe I took the number of stores at some point and divided it into our line of credit and determined, hey, they have spent over $100,000 per store. How does that happen? It had everything to do with how is our borrower performing? The financial statements seemed strong, but the use of our credit facility did not match what the financial statements were portraying.\n(Id. at 48-49).\n. In a interoffice memo dated June 26, 2009 from Erin Crozier, a WSFS credit analyst, and Foley to Steve Clark, Loan Committee Secretary, the extension was deemed a “Minor Modification” because the line of credit to UDI was a demand, not a term, note. (Ex. W-19, Foley Dep. at 40-41). The explanation for the modification was provided in the ''Comments/Reason'’ section of the memo:\nDuring the review period (3 months) the line had a high balance of $5.0MM and a low balance of $2.0MM. The line did not meet the requirement of 30 consecutive day rest period as it was just closed in March 2009. It is recommended that it be waived for this review period (3 months) and it will be reviewed again for the next 12 month period starting 6/30/09.\nThe 90 day extension is requested to allow more time to reevaluate the Borrower's financial statements.\n(Ex. W-44, WSFS 00541).\n. On July 14, 2009, an Indian-born teller at a WSFS branch recognized Singh as Batra, a man she knew from the local Indian community. (Ex. W-45, Conway Dep. at 15-16). It is not entirely clear whether it was Singh or a member of his family who went into the bank that day, but either way, that visit set in motion the events that resulted in the current litigation.\n. INTERPOL is the world’s largest police organization comprised of 190 member countries. INTERPOL, http://www.interpol.in1/ About-INTERPOL/Overview (last visited Nov. 10, 2015).\n. According to the INTERPOL website,\nINTERPOL Notices are international requests for cooperation or alerts allowing police in member countries to share critical crime-related information.\nNotices are published by INTERPOL’s General Secretariat at the request of National Central Bureaus (NCBs) and authorized entities ....\nIn the case of Red Notices, the persons concerned are wanted by national jurisdictions for prosecution or to serve a sentence based on an arrest warrant or court decision. INTERPOL’s role is to assist the national police forces in identifying and locating these persons with a view to their arrest and extradition or similar lawful action.\nINTERPOL, http://www.interpol.in1/ INTERPOL-expertise/Notices (last visited November 10, 2015) (emphasis added).\nAs further explained in the U.S. Attorneys’ Manual, a Red Notice “is the closest instrument to an international arrest warrant in use today.” Office of he United States Attorneys, http://www.justice.gov/us am/criminal-resource-manual-6 11 -interpol-red-notices (last visited November 10, 2015).\n.As WSFS explained in its brief:\nA PND restriction stops automated debiting of an account on uncollected funds, and creates a list of outgoing transfers initiated each day from the depositor’s accounts, so the bank can manually ensure that there are collected available funds and stop payment where there are not collected available funds. Otherwise, when a depositor has ACH capabilities, the transfers settle on an automated basis and may be processed by drawing on advance or provisional credit without review.\nThe PND restriction does not halt activity, as collected money will fund debits. The effect of the PND implemented by WSFS is that, if a depositor (like UDI) is determined to be a high risk customer, the PND stops the funding of outgoing transfers with provisional or advance credit without review, thereby protecting the bank from being an overdraft victim....\n(WSFS Memorandum of Law at 35-36 (\""WSFS Mem.”) (citing Ex. W-7, Brogan Dep. at 78-82).\n. The Trustee muddled the summary judgment record by referring to his documentary exhibits (other than deposition transcripts) by what appears to be the designation given to them at the various depositions and then lumping numerous exhibits together (not always sequentially) in attachments to the Motion designated as Exhibits A-Z. Having burrowed through the filing, I will continue to use the Trustee’s term for referencing the exhibits.\n. For ease of reference, the term \""UMI-UDI Transfers” will include the transfers that UEI made to UDI in the same time period. Those transfers were:\nOn July 15, 2009:\n1. $2,840,000.00 from UMI at TD Bank into UDI (\""First UMI Transfer”);\n2. $1,415,775.00 (aggregate sum) from UMI at TD Bank to UDI Account (\""Second UMI Transfer”);\n3. $1,850,000.00 (aggregate sum) from UEI at Bancorp bank (\""the First UEI Transfer”).\n(Trustee's Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment at ¶¶ 68-70).\nOn July 16, 2009:\n1.$2,925,000.00 from UMI at TD Bank into UDI (\""the Third UMI Transfer”);\n2. $1,242,050.00 (aggregate sum) from UMI at TD Bank into UDI (\""the Fourth UMI Transfer”)\n3. $1,400,000.00 (consisting of one or more checks) from UEI at Bancorp into UDI (\""Second UEI Transfer”).\n{Id. at ¶¶ 78-80).\n. As explained in WSFS’ expert report:\nAfter WSFS verified that the Debtor Transfers were collected funds and no longer subject to return or reversal from the sending banks, WSFS properly made the funds available to its customer. During the time period in question, UDI withdrew over $16 million from its WSFS accounts, to pay a variety of parties, including UMI and UEI, while $5,000,000 was appropriately applied to repay the WSFS demand line.\n(Ex. W-8, Roberts Report at 4).\n. I recognize that the comparative statistics cited in the text are not perfectly parallel. The $11 million in Outgoing Transfers includes two (2) days of transfers after the PND was lifted, but I could locate nothing in the record that compiled the total of outgoing transfers while the PND was in effect. In any event, the Trustee does not dispute that the Outgoing Transfers occurred while the PND was in effect. (See, e.g., Ex. W-67, McDaniel 000455) (referencing outgoing wire transfers in excess of $3.0 million on July 20, 2009).\n. Based on the substantive consolidation order and a second substantive consolidation order, entered at the Trustee's request and without objection, the Trustee auctioned various properties titled in the name of various Universal entities. The sale proceeds reduced TD Bank's secured claim against UMI and the consolidated bankruptcy estate. Also, on behalf of the estate, the Trustee retained some of the sale proceeds based on a carve-out agreement with TD Bank. (See Bky No. 09-15404, Doc. #’s 488, 529).\n. Besides UDI, the Affiliates were the other entities referenced in note 3, supra: UEI, Universal Management, Inc., Universal Distribution Inc., and Project Growth Technologies, Inc.\n. The somewhat tortuous procedural history of the Rule 12(b) litigation in this adversary proceeding is outlined in the court’s order dated June 14, 2012. (Id., Doc. #43). It is unnecessary to repeat it here.\n.The four (4) dismissed claims were:\nCount Four — a claim for breach of fiduciary duty;\nCount Five — a claim for declaratory judgment that WSFS is no longer a secured creditor of UDI and is obligated to file a termination statement as to its UCC-1;\nCount Nine — a preference claim under 11 U.S.C. § 547;\nCount Ten — a request that the court disallow any claim of WSFS until or unless WSFS pays the amount of any transfers that are avoided in this adversary proceeding, see 11 U.S.C. § 502(j).\nCount Three (the claim pursuant to 6 Del. C. § 4A-305 for failure to execute two (2) payment orders) was not dismissed, but WSFS’ motion was granted insofar as the Trustee sought relief in the form of consequential damages.\n. [W]hen a movant contends a nonmovant lacks crucial evidence, this factual contention must be supported in the same manner as any other factual contention made in a summary judgment motion, by reference to disclosure and discovery materials, admissions, affidavits or declarations, and the like. The eviden-tiary support for this assertion probably does not have to be thorough and detailed as when a movant attempts to show that the facts are undisputed. Nonetheless, because the rule explicitly requires a \""showing,” there must be at least enough evidentiary support for the assertion that the nonmovant lacks crucial evidence to demonstrate the movant's good faith. The nonmovant and the court should not face the burdens imposed by a summary judgment when the movant has no basis for its assertion.\nPolichuk, 506 B.R. at 405 (quoting 11-56 Moore’s Federal Practice—Civil § 56.40[1](b)[iv] (LexisNexis 2013)) (emphasis omitted).\n. The BLA, the Note and the CMA each state that the agreement is governed by Delaware law. Neither party has questioned that proposition.\n. An integration clause is a statement in the parties' written contract that the writing is intended to be the final expression of their agreement. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 209, cmt. b (“Restatement\""); Middle-town Concrete Products, Inc. v. Black Clawson Co., 802 F.Supp. 1135, 1145-46 (D.Del.1992).\n. The integration clause states that the \""Loan Documents\"" (the defined term encompassing the other documents executed in connection with the credit transaction) \""constitute the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the Loan.”\n. Conversely, a slight breach by one party to a contract will not terminate the obligations of the injured party to perform. Daystar Const., 2006 WL 2053649, at *7.\n.The integration clause in the CMA is part of the General Terms and Conditions Attachment. As stated earlier, see.n. 12, the Trustee disputes the authenticity of the General Terms and Conditions Attachment.\n. (Ex. W-16, Dovell Dep. at 33; Ex. W-17, Dovell Report at 8-11, 14-15).\n. (Ex. W-17 Dovell Report at 15-19).\n. (Ex. W-17, Dovell Report at 12-14; Ex. W-90, Manderino Report at 11).\n. I recognize that the environmental litigation involved a number of the properties owned by other Universal Network entities, not UDI. However, given UDI’s role as manager of numerous Universal Network entities, the litigation undoubtedly could have had an adverse impact on UDI’s business and financial condition (within the meaning of ¶ 3.1(e) of the BLA).\n. Separate and apart from the contractual analysis employed above in the text, (i.e UDI's material breach of express contractual provisions excused WSFS’ performance), Delaware law provides, more generally, that a contract may be voidable on the basis of misrepresentation, be it a fraudulent or an innocent misrepresentation. See Alabi, 583 A.2d at 1361. Such a misrepresentation may be asserted as an affirmative defense to a contract action. Id. In asserting misrepresentation as a defense, a party must establish that: (1) there was a misrepresentation; (2) the misrepresentation was either fraudulent or material; (3) the misrepresentation induced the recipient to enter into the contract; and (4) the recipient's reliance on the misrepresentation was reasonable. Id. at 1361-62 (citing Restatement § 164); Tekstrom Inc. v. Savla, 2006 WL 2338050, at *5 (Del.Super.Ct. July 31, 2006).\n. In his initial brief, the Trustee argued that WSFS breached the CMA by WSFS’ failure to give notice required by the CMA before altering its performance of its CMA obligations. That argument fails for the reasons expressed in the immediately preceding Part V.B.l, supra. The Trustee has no claim for breaches of the CMA due to UDI’s prior material breaches of the Loan.\nIn his Reply brief, the Trustee put forward a variation on that argument. He asserted, for the first time, that WSFS’ exercise of its loan default remedies in a manner that bleached its CMA obligations were taken in breach of WSFS’ prior notice obligation under the Loan Documents. (Tr. Reply Mem. at 5-6). I address this argument in the text below.\n. The Trustee’s argument also fails because the doctrine of contra proferentem is not applied where both parties have contributed to the drafting of a contract. See Sodano v. Am. Stock Exch. LLC, 2008 WL 2738583, at *13 n. 71 (Del.Ch. July 15, 2008), aff'd sub nom., Am. Stock Exch. LLC v. Fin. Indus. Regulatory Auth., Inc., 970 A.2d 256 (Del.2009). WSFS produced evidence that the notice provisions of the contracts were negotiated by counsel. (See Ex.W-9, Ryan Dep. at 106, 109). The doctrine of contra proferentem is not applicable in these circumstances.\n. To illustrate, previously accepted outbound ACH transfers from UDI to UMI were honored and other activity on UDI's deposit accounts proceeded at substantial levels after the PND restriction was put in place. This included $2,361,800.00 transferred from UDI to UMI on July 17, 2009 and $1,925,000.00 to UEI'on July 20, 2009. (See Ex. 110, July 2009 ACH Payments Account Statement at WSFS 00987) (transfers to UMI highlighted in yellow); Ex. 112, UDI July 2009 Corporate Check Payments Statement, at WSFS 01400-06) (check drawn highlighted in pink)).\n. In fact, thirteen (13) UDI checks totaling over $15,000.00 issued to third parties posted on July 17, 2009. (Ex. W-ll, GOL-WSFS 389302).\n. The Trustee’s Expert Report of Dan Schechter (Tr. Reply Mem., Ex. A) concluded that WSFS did not act in conformity with prevailing standards and practices within the commercial lending industry. The Report assumes that WSFS was required to declare a default and give notice to UDI under the ■ Loan, that WSFS unqualifiedly froze UDI's accounts when it instituted the PND, and that WSFS did not verify the Red Notice prior to setting off the Loan. The undisputed facts establish that the Trustee's version of the actions WSFS took upon discovery of the Red Notice are simply incorrect or vastly over simplified. As a result, the Schechter Report does not address the factual scenario presented in this proceeding and creates no issue of fact that prevents the entry of summary judgment.\n. Paragraph 5.2 of the BLA authorized . WSFS to exercise every remedy granted under the Loan Documents. Paragraph 7(b) of the Note authorized WSFS to exercise any rights available to it under the UCC or any applicable law. WSFS’ actions were consistent with the UCC and applicable Delaware law. See 6 Del. C. §§ 9-109(d)(10) (stating Article 9 does not apply to a right of setoff with two exceptions), 9-340 (set-off against deposit accounts), 9-404 (defenses or claims of an account debtor); see also Webster v. Beebe, 1 Boyce 314, 24 Del. 314, 317, 76 A. 54 (Del. 1910) (discussing common law right to setoff under Delaware law); Davis v. 913 North Mkt. St. Pshp., 1996 WL 769326, *2 (Del.Super.Ct. Dec. 12, 1996) (same).\n. Generally, the reasonableness of WSFS' actions is a fact issue that would be decided at trial. However, I conclude that no trier of fact could find that WSFS’ conduct was unreasonable, arbitrary or in bad faith. In these circumstances, a court may grant summary judgment. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (summary judgment standard is \""very close” to directed verdict standard where both inquire whether \""the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law”); Curley v. Klem, 499 F.3d 199, 210 (3d Cir.2007) (judge may decide issue of reasonableness once all historical facts are no longer in dispute); see also Mundell v. DBA/ DMC Mining Servs. Corp., 2014 WL 7911147, at *4 (M.D.Pa. Apr. 2, 2014) (making mixed-fact law determination at summary judgment based on undisputed historical facts).\n. The Trustee requested \""consequential damages, compensatoiy damages, direct and indirect damages, punitive damages, setoff, recoupment, credits, interest, costs of suit, attorneys’ fees and legal expenses, and for such other and further relief that the Court deems just, proper, and equitable” for WSFS’s failure to execute the First and Second TD Bank Transfer Orders. (Second Am. Compl. \""wherefore clause,” at 24). However, the Trustee’s request for consequential damages was dismissed for purposes of trial by the Order entered June 15, 2012 (Adv. No. 11-512, Doc. #43), and the Trustee did not seek leave to amend Count Three in its Motion to Amend the First Amended Complaint. Thus, the Trustee's request for damages under Count Three is limited to \""expenses in the transaction and for incidental expenses and interest losses resulting from the failure to execute.” {Id.).\n. The Trustee cited the \""actual intent” provisions in both the Second Amended Complaint and his motion for summary judgment.\n. The concept that the record recipient of a transfer may not be the initial transferee also finds expression in the related “conduit theory” doctrine. An entity that receives a transfer may not be a \""transferee” at all, but only a \""mere conduit” if the transfer is for the limited purpose of allowing the entity to pass the asset through to another party. \""The key characteristic of a conduit is that the person or entity is under a contractual or other obligation to use the transferred funds or assets for the benefit of a third party and may not put those funds or assets to its own use.” Polichuk, 506 B.R. at 450.\n. The Incomnet court also observed that \""[a] number of circuits combined these tests — or at least combined their names — creating a ‘dominion and control test’ to determine whether a party is an initial transferee.” 463 F.3d at 1071.\nIn a slight variation, the Eleventh Circuit applies the \""conduit or control” test as an “equitable exception” to the literal or rigid interpretation of the statutory term \""initial transferee,\"" most commonly thought of as the first recipient of fraudulently-transferred funds. In re Harwell, 628 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2010). In Harwell, the circuit court added \""good faith” as an element of the equitable exception:\n[I]nitial recipients of the debtor's fraudulently-transferred funds who seek to take advantage of equitable exceptions to § 550(a)(l)’s statutory language must establish (1) that they did not have control over the assets received, i.e., that they merely served as a conduit for the assets that were under the actual control of the debtor-trans-feror and (2) that they acted in good faith and as an innocent participant to the fraudulent transfer.\nId.\n. WSFS disputes this, pointing to the Trustee's deposition, in which he stated that substantive consolidation was beneficial to the bankruptcy estate because it provided a means of bringing the § 553 claim against WSFS. (WSFS Mem. at 90). In the deposition, the Trustee could cite to no other ground for extending substantive consolidation to include UDI nunc pro tunc to UMI’s petition date of July 23, 2009.\nThe Trustee’s deposition testimony provides little support to WSFS. The testimony merely reflects the state of affairs existing after substantive consolidation already had been applied to the creditors other than WSFS.\n. In Owens Coming, the Third Circuit left open the question whether a creditor may carve itself out of the effects of substantive consolidation. See, 419 F.3d at 210 n. 16, 212 n. 22 (discussing possibility of partial consolidation). Right or wrong, that is what occurred in this case, subject to the parties’ agreement that the Trustee retained the right to expand the partial consolidation to encompass WSFS.\n. The deadline for filing claims has expired. (See Order dated March 10, 2010; Bky. No. 09-15404, Doc. #297).\n. Previously, I entered an interlocutory order, dismissing certain counts of the Trustee's Amended Complaint that, similarly were either non-core or core claims as to which the bankruptcy court lacks constitutional authority to enter a final judgment, absent consent of the parties. (See Order dated June 14, 2012; Adv. No. 11-512, Doc. #43). Specifically, that Order dismissed the Trustee’s Count Four (breach of fiduciary duty) and Count Nine (11 U.S.C. § 547 preference) claims. The Trustee did not re-plead those claims in his Second Amended Complaint.\nThe June 14, 2012 order’s dismissal of Counts Four and Nine also was for purposes of trial in the bankruptcy court, not the entry of a final order or judgment of dismissal. Consequently, the comprehensive Report and Recommendation that I will transmit to the bankruptcy court at the conclusion of this adversary proceeding also will recommend that the district court enter an appropriate order with respect to those claims."",""type"":""majority""}],""judges"":[],""head_matter"":""IN RE : UNIVERSAL MARKETING, INC., Debtor.

The Limited Nature of this Court’s Order Resolving the Cross-Motions\nX. CONCLUSION\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn July 2009, Universal Marketing, Inc. (“the Debtor” or “UMI”) was one (1) of more than seventy (70) entities in a vertically integrated business (“the Universal Network”). The Universal Network operated approximately thirty-six (36) gas stations in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and also distributed gasoline to unaffiliated gas stations.\nOn July 23, 2009, UMI commenced this chapter 11 bankruptcy case. UMI was the only Universal Network entity that filed a bankruptcy petition. The reorganization phase of the case was sbort-lived; the case was converted to chapter 7 on August 18, 2009.\nEight (8) months after the conversion of the case, on April 19, 2010, Charles R. Goldstein, the chapter 7 trustee (“the Trustee”) filed a motion seeking substantive consolidation of UMI’s estate with the estates of certain other Universal Network entities, including Universal Delaware, Inc. (“UDI”). Wilmington Savings Fund Society (“WSFS”), a bank that provided both commercial credit and cash management \'services to UDI, contested the Trustee’s motion for substantive consolidation.\nOn August 4, 2010, with the consent of all parties, the court entered an order resolving the substantive consolidation issue. The August 4, 2010 Order largely granted the substantive consolidation relief sought by the Trustee. However, the substantive consolidation order excepted WSFS from certain aspects of the Order, in ways to be discussed in more detail below.\nHi ❖ % H* H<\nIn this adversary proceeding, the Trustee seeks to recover money from WSFS based on a variety of claims which may be grouped into three (3) legal cátegories.\nFirst, the Trustee raises what the parties have referred to as “common law” claims, seeking to impose liability for breach of contract. The Trustee asserts that a “post no debits” policy WSFS implemented as to UDI’s bank accounts for a few days in July 2009 breached the UDI-WSFS contract and triggered a “chain-reaction liquidity crisis” throughout the entire Universal Network that “single-handedly sentenced [the] Universal [Network] ... to [its] financial death.”\nSecond, based largely on the same events giving rise to his common law claims, the Trustee asserts a statutory claim under 6 Del. C. § 4A.\nThird, the Trustee asserts traditional bankruptcy transfer avoidance legal theories (preference, fraudulent transfers) under 11 U.S.C. §§ 544, 547, 548, 550, 553(b),. analysis of which is more complex due to the substantive consolidation issues also present in the proceeding.\nIn response, WSFS maintains that the Trustee’s common law claims are based on a gross exaggeration or mischaracterization of the undisputed facts. WSFS contends, quite simply, that it did nothing more than exercise ordinary and proper, garden-variety contractual remedies against UDI after UDI breached its contractual duties to WSFS in various ways (including fraudulently inducing WSFS to enter into the banking and lending relationship with UDI in the first place). WSFS also asserts that no avoidable transfers occurred.\nH* Hí ^ Hs H*\nPresently before the court are the parties’ cross-motions for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability.\nAs explained in Part IX.B., infra, all of the claims at issue are either (1) non-core claims, which require transmission of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court absent consent of the parties, see 28 U.S.C. § 157(c)(1), or (2) core claims, for which the bankruptcy court lacks constitutional authority to enter a final judgment (again, absent consent of the parties), see Stern v. Marshall, — U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2594, 180 L.Ed.2d 475 (2011). In both its Answer to the Second Amended Complaint and its main brief on summary judgment, WSFS unequivocally declined to consent to the entry of a final judgment by the bankruptcy court. Cf. Wellness Int’l Network, Ltd. v. Sharif, — U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1932, 191 L.Ed.2d 911 (2015) (parties may consent to entry of judgment by bankruptcy court). Therefore, I cannot enter a final judgment for either party in this adversary proceeding.\nFor the reasons stated below, I conclude that WSFS is entitled to summary judgment on all but one (1) of the Trustee’s claims, there being one (1) claim in which there are disputed issues of material fact, and that the Trustee is not entitled to summary judgment on any of his claims. In light of the court’s constitutional inability to enter a final order, I will enter an order that dismisses the Trustee’s claims (save one) for purposes of trial of this adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court. At the conclusion of the proceedings in this court, I will issue a comprehensive Report and- Recommendation to the district court for the entry of an appropriate order with respect to all claims as to which the bankruptcy court lacks authority to enter a final judgment.\nII. FACTS\nA. General Structure of the Universal Network\nThe Universal Network was a vertically integrated business involved in the purchase of gasoline and its resale to both Universal entities and to unrelated, third-party businesses. Generally, each of the Universal Network gas stations was owned or leased by a single purpose entity (“SPE”). Within the Universal Network, UMI served as the entity that purchased gasoline from major oil companies and then resold the gasoline to the SPE’s and the unrelated third parties. UDI, acted as the management company for UMI and the SPE’s. Daniel Singh (f/k/a Daminder Batra) (“Singh”) was the principal of UDI and many, if not all, of the other Universal Network entities.\nIn 2009, UMI and UDI each had separate banking relationships — UMI with TD Bank and UDI with WSFS. Other Universal Network entities had banking relationships with other institutions, such as Wa-chovia Bank, Citizens Bank, The Bancorp Bank and PNC Bank, N.A.\nThe cash needs of the various entities were met by numerous inter-company money transfers, often in the magnitude of hundreds of thousands of dollars on a daily basis.\nBy July 2009, the banking relationships that UMI and UDI had with TD Bank and WSFS, respectively, soured. That month, within a few days of each other, TD Bank locked down UMI’s bank accounts and WSFS took similar action against UDI (restricting temporarily, in a manner described in more detail below, outgoing transfers from UDI’s accounts).\nThe dispute before me centers on UDI’s and WSFS’ lending and cash management relationships.\nB. The Formation of the UDI-WSFS Relationship\n■UDI and WSFS first connected in November 2008, when Singh inquired about WSFS’ loan and banking services. (Ex. W-29, WSFS 02026). Following several meetings between Singh and various WSFS representatives, WSFS made a presentation to Singh for cash management services. (Ex. W-30, WSFS 02019). In exchange, Singh provided the “company’s financials.” (Id.). William Foley (“Foley”), WSFS’ Vice President and Relationship Manager, considered the financial reports “quite strong.” (Id.). Singh ultimately requested a $5 million line of credit.\nOn January 26, 2009, Foley submitted a Credit Memorandum to WSFS’ Senior Loan Committee (“the Credit Memorandum”). (Ex. W-31). The Credit Memorandum sought approval for a $5 million working capital line of credit to be used for UDI’s “general working capital needs,” as well as a credit facility and a cash management offering for the prospect of yielding annual account analysis fees of $134 million. (Ex. W-31, WSFS 00527). The terms included “principal due on demand,” a “blanket UCC on all business assets” and an “unlimited guarantee of Daniel Singh.” (Id.). At that time, WSFS did not require financials for UMI because UDI was creditworthy, had a strong balance sheet and was profitable. (Ex. W-28, Foley 2004 Exam, at 56). Nor did the request involve financing for UMI because WSFS understood UMI had its own separate banking relationship. According to Foley, “It was a separate business.” (Id.).\nIn March 2009, UDI and WSFS executed several agreements to formalize two (2) relationships: (1) a lending relationship, designed to provide UDI with working capital for its business operations; and (2) a banking services relationship, in which WSFS provided a variety of cash management services to UDI.\nC. The Lending Relationship\nOn March 19, 2009, UDI and WSFS entered into a line of credit loan transaction (“the Loan”). The Loan was memorialized by various documents, including a Business Loan Agreement (“BLA”), Promissory Note (“the Note”), Security Agreement, Guaranty (“the Guaranty”), Confession of Judgment, and an Assignment of Leases and Rents. (See Ex. W-14). The Note defined these documents collectively as “the Loan Documents.” (Ex. W-14, WSFS 00276, Note ¶ 3 (hanging paragraph)).\n1. the Business Loan Agreement\nThe BLA obligated WSFS to make available to UDI a commercial line of credit in the principal sum of $5 million. (Ex. W-14, WSFS 0259, BLÁ ¶ 1.1). UDI agreed to repay the Loan which was evidenced by the Note. (Id. ¶ 1.2).\nThe BLA includes several representations that UDI made to induce WSFS to extend the Loan. Among those relevant to the pending motions were:\n• There were no actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened which would have a material adverse effect on UDI’s ability to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents. (Id., WSFS 00260, BLA ¶ 3.1(c)).\n• UDI disclosed “in writing all facts that could have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of [UDI] or any collateral for the Loan.” (Id., WSFS 00261, BLA ¶ 3.1(e)).\n• UDI’s and Singh’s financial statements were true\' and correct and presented fairly, accurately and completely, the financial position of UDI and Singh. (7d ¶ 3.1(f)).\n• UDI’s assets were held free of other encumbrances and UDI was not obligated to another creditor under a guaranty agreement. (Id. ¶ 3.1(g)).\n• UDI would maintain its primary depository account and cash management relationship with WSFS for the term of the Loan. (Id., WSFS 00264, BLA ¶ 4.1(k)).\n• all representations and warranties of UDI and Singh (as guarantor) were true in all material respects. (Id., WSFS 00260, ¶ 2.2(b)).\nThe BLA enumerated several events of default:\n• Any material false or misleading statement, certificate, representation or warranty by UDI to WSFS. (Id., WSFS 00267, BLA ¶ 5.1(h)).\n• Failure to make timely any payment required under the Loan. (Id., WSFS 00266, BLA ¶ 5.1(a)).\n• Any event of default under the Promissory Note or any of the Loan Documents. (Id. ¶ 5.1(b)).\n• The prospects of the repayment of the Loan becoming materially jeopardized or impaired in the reasonable judgment of WSFS. (Id., WSFS 00267, BLA ¶ 5.1(i)).\n• UDI’s use of the Loan proceeds for something other than the permitted uses. (Id. ¶ 5.1(¿)).\nThe BLA expressly provided that WSFS “shall have no obligation to provide notice of an Event of Default.” (Id. ¶ 5.1 (hanging paragraph)).\nThe BLA provided various remedies to WSFS in the event of a default:\n• acceleration of the balance of the Loan, without any further demand or notice. (Id. ¶ 5.2(a)).\n• increase of the interest rate to an applicable default rate, without notice. (JcL\\ 5.2(b)).\n• any remedy available under applicable law. (Id., SFS 00268, BLA ¶ 5.2(c)).\n2. the Note\nThe Note provided for a $5 million revolving credit facility, with a term commencing on March 19, 2009, with monthly installments of interest on the principal balance, due on the 19th of each month. (Ex. W-14, WSFS 00274-00275, Note Preamble & ¶ 2(b)). The Note provided for its term to end upon demand by WSFS, in its discretion, at any time, and yearly extensions of the facility, the first extension falling on June 30, 2009, just slightly more than three (3) months after the inception of the Loan. (Id. ¶ 2(a)). The Note also required UDI to reduce the principal balance to zero ($0.00) once per year upon request of WSFS, beginning after June 30, 2009, and to maintain a zero balance for thirty (30) days before UDI could once again draw down on the facility. (Id., WSFS 00276, Note ¶ 2(1)).\nParagraph 6 of the Note specified both monetary and non-monetary Events of Default, including:\n• UDI’s failure to make any interest or principal payment\' when due (id., WSFS 00278, Note ¶ 6(a), (b));\n• UDI’s failure to maintain its primary deposit account and cash management relationship with WSFS as required by the Loan Agreement (id. ¶ 6(d)); and\n• the occurrence of any other default or Event to Default under the Note or the Loan Documents (id. ¶ 6(e)).\nParagraph 7 of the Note provided certain remedies to WSFS in the Event of Default, including the right to accelerate the Loan without presentation, demand, or protest. (Id. ¶ 7(a)). Like the BLA, the Note imposed no obligation on WSFS to provide notice of an Event of Default. (Id. ¶ 6 (hanging paragraph)). UDI expressly waived any notices (including presentment for payment, dishonor, and protest) under the Note. (Id., WSFS 00279, Note ¶ 9(a)).\n3. the Guaranty\nUnder the Guaranty, Singh served as an absolute and unconditional guarantor of the Loan. Upon default, the Guaranty allowed WSFS to proceed against Singh initially and directly without having to proceed against any other property first. (Id., WSFS 00303, Guaranty Agreement ¶ 2).\nThe Guaranty enumerated several events of default, including:\nif any information contained in any financial statement, application, report, schedule, report, or other document given by [Singh or UDI] in\' connection with the Loan ... is not in all material respects true or accurate or if [Singh or UDI] omitted to state any material fact or any fact necessary to make such information not misleading.”\n(7<£¶70>)).\nIn the event of default, the Guaranty granted WSFS the right to accelerate the indebtedness, whether due or not, and required Singh to pay the Loan on demand with immediately available funds. (Id. ¶ 7(hanging paragraph)).\nD. The Banking Relationship (Cash Management Services Agreement)\nOn March 13, 2009, UDI and WSFS entered into a Cash Management Services Agreement (“the CMA”), which required WSFS to provide certain financial services to UDI. (See Ex. W-38). Generally, the relationship provided that WSFS would: maintain multiple deposit accounts for UDI; utilize automatic clearing houses; sweep funds into a single account on an automated basis; and permit the transfer of funds in and out of the accounts via use of the internet.\nThe CMA consisted of several documents for each of the selected services, including “riders.” Certain of these documents will be described in more detail in connection with the Trustee’s contract claim and his statutory claim under 6 Del. C. § 4A. See Parts V.B. and VLB., infra.\nE. The Demise of the UDI-WSFS Relationship\n1. WSFS’ suspicions arise\nIn May 2009, less than two (2) months after formalizing its relationship with UDI, WSFS developed concerns about its new customer. Its suspicions arose after a flurry of Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) activity and a $1 million dollar transfer occurred on May 1, 2009. (Ex. W-19, Foley Dep. at 35-38; Ex. W-20, WSFS 02568). Also, UDI quickly drew down the entire $5 million credit line, necessitating a conversation between Foley and Singh later that month. (Ex. W-28, Foley Dep. at 97). Singh explained the full usage of the line was for capital expenditures. (Id.). This was not an intended use of the line, however, because it was set up for short-term working capital. (Id.).\nThe next month (June 2009), UDI sought to borrow an additional, $2.1 million from WSFS, increasing the credit line to $7.1 million. Foley, as UDI’s customer representative and relationship manager, prepared a credit memo to present UDI’s new request to WSFS’s Loan Committee. (See Ex. W-40). Glenn Kocher, Chair of the Loan Committee and Chief Credit Officer, was uncomfortable with the request. (Ex. W-37, Kocher Dep. at 45). He initially understood UDI to be a “healthy company,” (Id. at 72), but given UDI’s misuse of the credit line at such a rapid pace, he questioned the accuracy of UDI’s initial financial statements. Kocher deferred the request so that Foley could look beyond UDI’s financials to develop a more complete picture of all of Singh’s companies. (Ex. W-37, Kocher Dep. at 45; Ex. W-28, Foley Dep. at 105-7). Accordingly, in conjunction with its additional borrowing request, UDI provided to WSFS certain financial documentation, including a 2007 corporate tax return for UMI and a “review” level financial statement for years-ending December 31, 2006 through December 31, 2008. (Ex. W-28, Foley Dep. at 103, 106-7; Ex. W-44, WSFS 00541).\nBased on its concerns, WSFS did not act on the request for additional credit. It also deferred a decision on extending the existing credit facility under ¶ 2(a) of the Note by pushing out its internal review date for ninety (90) days, from June 30, 2009 to September 30, 2009. (Ex. W-44, WSFS 00541).\n2. WSFS’ discovery of and response to the “Red Notice”\nA dramatic turn of events took place a few weeks later. On the evening of Tuesday, July 14, 2009, WSFS learned that Singh might have another identity. While certain facts are in dispute as to exactly how WSFS became aware of this information, it is clear from the record that WSFS learned that Singh might also be known as “Daminder Batra,” an individual wanted for fraud and money laundering in India. (Ex. W-45, Conway Dep. at 15-16). Upon learning of this possibility, WSFS management searched the internet and viewed an INTERPOL web site where Singh’s face was posted as a “wanted” person. (Id. at 21). The “INTERPOL Notice” listed the “Categories of Offences” as “Counterfeiting/Forgery Conspiracy, Fraud, Fraud Conspiracy,” with the “Arrest Warrant Issued by /India, Allahabad/Indi\'a, Mumbai/India,” and instructed in all capitals and bold typeface: “IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION CONTACT YOUR NATIONAL OR LOCAL POLICE.” (Ex. W-46, WSFS 01523). Throughout the litigation, the parties have referred to this notice as “the Red Notice.”\nThe next day (Wednesday, July 15, 2009), the. Red Notice was brought to the attention of WSFS’ security department. Foley confirmed to the security department that the face of “Batra” on the Red Notice was Singh. (Ex. W-19, Foley Dep. at 42). That evening, following several emails and meetings, WSFS management resolved they still needed to authenticate the Red Notice, but in an abundance of caution, placed a “post no debits” (“PND”) restriction on the UDI accounts, effective the next business day, July 16, 2009. (Ex. W-2, WSFS 006171). The PND was put in place to stop automated debiting and allow WSFS time to review UDI’s account and ensure there were sufficient funds for outgoing transfers. (Ex. W-7, Brogan Dep. at 78-79, 81-82).\nThe next morning (Thursday, July 16, 2009), while WSFS continued its investigation, the PND went into effect on a prospective basis. The PND did not prevent transactions already in the system from settling on an automated basis. (Ex. W-7, Brogan Dep. at 78). Consequently, two (2) transfer orders sent to TD Bank (for the benefit of UMI) consisting of six (6) transfers totaling $2,490,150.00 on July 15, 2009 (“the First TD Bank Transfer Order”), and another six (6) transfers totaling $2,689,525.00 on July 16, 2009 (“the Second TD Bank Transfer Order”), settled on July 15 and 16, 2009, respectively. (Ex. W-23, TD 09888-09889, TD 09892; Ex. W-7, Brogan Dep. at 71-72, 75, 78; Ex. W-8, Roberts Report at 21; Ex. W-ll). WSFS quickly requested a reversal of the First TD Bank Transfer Order, which was successful. (Exs. Tr.-41, 42). TD Bank reversed the transaction and returned the funds to WSFS on July 17, 2009. (Ex. W-23, TD 09924). TD Bank refused WSFS’s request to reverse the Second TD Bank Transfer Order for lack of sufficient funds. (Ex. W-105, WSFS 00587; Ex. W-8, Roberts Report at 24; Ex. W-23 at TD 09919-09920).\nBy the end of day on July 16, 2009, after having spoken to two (2) FBI agents, WSFS confirmed that the Red Notice was authentic and there was an actual arrest warrant in India for Singh. (Ex. W-4, WSFS 03844; Ex.W-50, Kearney Dep. at 14-15 (confirming Red Notice was on a valid web site); Ex. Tr.-M, Foley Dep. at 91). WSFS also determined that UDI’s primary operating account was expected to have approximately $5.8 million in it by the close of business that day. (Ex. W-4, WSFS 03844). Accordingly, WSFS decided to transfer $5 million of those funds and credit them to a general ledger suspense account to insure there were funds available to pay off the Loan. (Ex. Tr.-65, WSFS 02456; Ex. W-4, WSFS 03844).\nWSFS put a few other precautionary processes in motion that day. It immediately implemented: UDI’s “line sweep” be turned off, all “money room deposits” be accepted, Foley’s authorization be obtained for cash orders through the “money room vault,” and any communication with Singh should be with Foley. (Exs. Tr.-66, WSFS 05877; Tr.-67, WSFS 05879; Tr.-69, WSFS 05881; Tr.-70, WSFS 05882). Essentially, WSFS wanted to assure that all deposits were accepted and made Foley the point of contact and responsible for determining which debits the bank would permit.\nThursday, July 16, 2009, concluded with Mark Turner, President of WSFS, sending an email (at 8:45 pm) reiterating his message that UDI should be given the benefit of the doubt; that the goal was to protect the bank’s interest while treating UDI with respect and the presumption that it was a misunderstanding. (Ex. W-4, WSFS 03844). At this point, no one from WSFS had contacted UDI to discuss WSFS’ concerns or suspicions about Singh’s identity or to explain the internal actions WSFS had taken pertaining to the UDI accounts. (Ex. W-4, WSFS 03844; Tr.-170).\nThe next morning (Friday, July 17, 2009), WSFS retained Garvan McDaniel as counsel to handle the UDI matter. (Ex. W-52, McDaniel Dep. at 21-22). Thereafter, McDaniel called UDI’s attorney, Kevin Ryan, and advised Ryan (or one of his colleagues) about:\n(1) the Red Notice (which he later emailed to Ryan around noon);\n(2) Singh’s alias;\n(3) the PND restriction;\n(4) the need for the parties to work together and ensure there were sufficient collected funds in the account before attempting to make withdrawals or outgoing transfers;\n(5) WSFS’ placement of $5 million on deposit in a suspense account; and\n(6) WSFS’s right to demand payment of the Loan.\n(Ex. W-9, Ryan Dep. at 34-36; 121; Ex. W-52, McDaniel Dep. at 24, 37-39; Ex. W-54, WSFS 000494; Ex. W-55, WSFS 000495).\nThat afternoon, Ryan asked McDaniel for UDI to have “access to the funds in excess of what [WSFS] needed to offset [the] loan.” (Ex. W-56, WSFS 06756). The two (2) attorneys also scheduled a conference call the following Monday morning. (Ex. W-9, Ryan Dep. at 125). Meanwhile, the PND restriction remained in place.\nOn Monday morning (July 20, 2009), McDaniel advised Ryan that WSFS removed the PND restriction from all accounts, and online banking capabilities for ACH and wire transfers had been reinstated. (Ex. W-67, WSFS 000457). That afternoon, WSFS applied the $5 million that had been previously moved to the general ledger account on July 16th, to formally repay the Loan (“the Setoff’). (Ex. W-60, WSFS 00922; Ex. Tr.-L, Foley Dep. at 198).\n3. effect of the PND\nOn July 15 and 16, 2009, while the PND was in effect, UDI received over $11.6 million dollars in transfers from UMI and UEI (“the UMI-UDI Transfers”). In turn, between July 15 to July 22, 2009, UDI transferred over $11 million out of its WSFS accounts to pay a variety of parties including UMI and UEI (“the Outgoing Transfers”). (Ex. W-8, Roberts Report at 4, 2324). The $11 million in Outgoing Transfers does not include the $5 million transferred to WSFS to repay the Loan.\nOn July 23, 2009, three (3) days after WSFS transferred the $5 million to satisfy the Loan, UMI filed its chapter 11 bankruptcy petition.\nIII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nA. Main Case\nAs stated above, on July 23, 2009, UMI ■commenced this chapter 11 bankruptcy case. The case was converted to chapter 7 on August 18, 2009. On September 24, 2009, the U.S. Trustee filed a report giving notice that Goldstein had been elected as chapter 7 trustee.\nOn April 19, 2010, the Trustee filed a motion requesting that substantive consolidation of the UMI bankruptcy estate with some, but not all, of the non-debtor Universal Network affiliates (“the Substantive Consolidation Motion”). (Bky. No. 09-15404, Doc. # 316). UDI was one of the entities to be included in the substantive consolidation.\nThe Trustee’s request was based largely on his view that:\n• inter-company transfers “of an incredible magnitude” occurred daily without the maintenance of “formal records;”\n• the assets within the Universal Network (largely in the form of cash) “were effectively commingled” that the reconstruction and reconciliation of the accounting records among the separate entities “would be an astronomically expensive, if not impossible, task;” and,\n• certain large creditors “appear to have relied upon the overall financial position of the Universal Network as a whole, as opposed to any one of its discreet member entities.”\n(Memorandum in Support of Trustee’s Motion for Substantive Consolidation at 4-5, 13, 17) (Bky. No. 09-15404, Doc. #317); see generally In re Owens Corning, 419 F.3d 195 (3d Cir.2005) (controlling case stating legal standards for substantive consolidation).\nThe Trustee and TD Bank entered into a settlement resolving several issues between them. Pursuant to that agreement, TD Bank supported the Trustee’s request for substantive consolidation. (Bky. No. 09-15404, Doc. # 366). On June 8, 2010, WSFS filed a lengthy objection to the Substantive Consolidation Motion. (Bky. No. 09-15404, Doc. # 364).\nThe parties reached a global settlement of the Substantive Consolidation Motion and two (2) other pending motions. That settlement was approved by court order dated August 4, 2010. (Bky. No. 09-15404, Doc. # 410).\nThe August 4, 2010 Order provided for the substantive consolidation of the UMI bankruptcy estate nunc pro tunc with five (5) other Universal entities, including UDI (collectively, “the Affiliates”).\nMost relevant to this adversary proceeding, the August 4, 2010 Order included a significant qualification. The Order provided that the substantive consolidation of UMI and UDI would not “impact any rights concerning WSFS.” (Id. ¶ 7). WSFS was excepted from the effects of the substantive consolidation order. Instead, as to WSFS, the parties agreed that the Affiliates, including UDI, would be deemed to have filed a bankruptcy as of August 4, 2010 and that the UDI and UMI estates would be treated as being jointly administered, not substantively consolidated. Significantly, the parties also agreed that the Trustee retained the right to seek to extend the effect of the substantive consolidation to WSFS nunc pro tunc to the date of UMI’s bankruptcy filing, July 23, 2009, with WSFS reserving all of its rights to challenge the request for such relief. (Id. ¶ 7.a.).\nB. Adversary Proceeding\nOn July 18, 2011, the Trustee initiated this adversary proceeding by filing a complaint. (Adv. No. 11-512, Doc. # 1). On January 13, 2012, the Trustee filed an amended complaint. (Id., Doc. #’s 30, 35). WSFS sought dismissal of the initial complaint and, later, the amended complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6)) (incorporated by Fed. R.. Bankr.P. 7012). By order dated June 14, 2012, I granted in part and denied in part WSFS’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint. (Id., Doc. # 43). I also granted the Trustee leave to file a second amended complaint. Initially, the Trustee did not do so. WSFS then filed an Answer to the Amended Complaint on July 18, 2012.\nOn December 6, 2013, the Trustee filed a motion seeking leave to file a second amended complaint. (Id., Doc. # 129). WSFS objected. By Order dated January 15, 2014, I granted the motion. (Id., Doc. # 161). The Trustee filed his second amended complaint (“the Second Amended Complaint”) on January 24, 2014. (Id., Doc. # 170). WSFS filed its Answer on February 19, 2014. (Id., Doc. # 176).\nSix (6) of the original ten (10) claims pleaded in the Amended Complaint survived WSFS’ Motion to Dismiss Case, in whole or in part. Those surviving claims are:\nCount One — in contract, for breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing;\nCount Two — breach of contract;\nCount Three — under 6 Del. C. § 4A-305 for failure to execute two (2) “payment orders;”\nCount Six — avoidance and recovery of fraudulent transfers under 11 U.S.C. §§ 544 and 550;\nCount Seven — avoidance and recovery of fraudulent transfers under 11 U.S.C. §§ 548 and 550;\nCount Eight — avoidance of setoff under 11 U.S.C. §§ 553 and 550.\nBy order dated September 24, 2012, after consideration of their Rule 26(f) Discovery Report, a number of conferences with counsel and additional status reports, I entered a pretrial order that set July 81, 2013 as the deadline for completion of all discovery. (Adv. No. 11-512, Doc. # 69). The parties then engaged in extensive discovery—for the most part, in a collaborative, cooperative manner — and requested a number of extensions of the discovery deadline. By virtue of Pretrial Order # 10, dated April 23, 2014, all discovery concluded on June 18, 2014. (Id., Doc. # 182).\nOn May 30, 2014, the Trustee filed a motion for partial summary judgment, seeking summary judgment as to liability only with respect to Counts One, Two, Three, She and Seven. (IcL, Doc. # 193). The Trustee supported his motion with evidentiary matter and a memorandum of law. On July 31, 2014, WSFS filed its response to the Trustee’s Motion and its own motion for summary judgment with accompanying evidentiary matter and a memorandum of law. (Id., Doc. #206). Each side then filed reply memoranda, the last of which was filed on September 11, 2014. (Id., Doe. #’s 213, 216).\nIV. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), applicable in this adversary proceeding by virtue of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7056, provides that summary judgment must be granted to a moving party when, drawing all reasonable infer-enees in favor of the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. E.g., Tri-M Group, LLC v. Sharp, 638 F.3d 406, 415 (3d Cir.2011); In re Bath, 442 B.R. 377, 387 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.2010). Summary judgment is appropriate if there are no disputed issues of material fact and the undisputed facts would require a directed verdict in favor of the movant. See Fitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, 2 F.3d 1112, 1115 (11th Cir.1993).\nOn a motion for summary judgment, the court’s role is not to weigh the evidence, but to determine whether there is a disputed, material fact for resolution at trial. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A genuine issue of material fact is one in which sufficient evidence exists that would permit a reasonable fact finder to return a verdict for the non-moving party. Id. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505. However, if it appears that the evidence “is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law,” the court shall enter judgment accordingly in that party’s favor. Id. at 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505.\nProper resolution of a motion for summary judgment also requires consideration of the parties’ respective burdens.\nIf the moving party bears the burden of proof, the movant must “support its motion with credible evidence ... that would entitle it to a directed verdict if not controverted at trial.” Fitzpatrick, 2 F.3d at 1115 (citation omitted). The evidence must establish “all the essential elements of its case on which it bears the burden of proof at trial, [such that] no reasonable jury could find for the non-moving party.” Id. (citation omitted); see also Bath, 442 B.R. at 387. If the movant (with the burden of proof at trial) meets this initial burden, the responding party may not rest on the pleadings, but must designate specific factual averments through the use of affidavits or other permissible evidentiary material which demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact to be resolved at trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505.\nIf the moving party does not bear the burden of proof at trial, the movant may establish it is entitled to judgment either by demonstrating that the undisputed facts negate an element of the plaintiffs claim or that the plaintiff lacks evidence to support an essential element of his claim. In re Polichuk, 506 B.R. 405, 422 (Bankr. E.D.Pa.2014) (citing Orson, Inc. v. Miramax Film Corp., 79 F.3d 1358, 1366 (3d Cir.1996) and Quaker Stpie Minit-Lube, Inc. v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co., 868 F.Supp. 1278, 1287 n. 5 (D.Utah 1994)).\nIn this adversary proceeding, with respect to certain claims, WSFS contends that the Trustee’s evidence is insufficient to permit this dispute to proceed to trial. Thus, WSFS’ burden on summary judgment “may be discharged by ‘showing’— that is, pointing out to the [trial] court—that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).\nV. WSFS IS ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE TRUSTEE’S CONTRACT CLAIMS (COUNTS ONE AND TWO)\nIn Counts One and Two of the Second Amended Complaint, the Trustee asserts two (2) distinct breach of contract claims pertaining to the Loan and the CMA: (1) breach of express contractual provisions and (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\nA. Threshold Issue: the Relationship between the Loan and the CMA\nPrior to evaluating whether there was a breach of contract under either theory, I must consider the relationship between the Loan and the CMA. The Trustee contends that the Loan and CMA are separate contracts. (Trustee Reply Memorandum Support of Summary Judgment at 3; Adv. No. 11-512, Doc. #213) (“Tr.Reply”). WSFS disagrees, arguing that the Loan and CMA were part of a larger integrated business lending transaction that requires the documents to be interpreted as a single agreement in order to give effect to the parties’ intent.\nThe distinction is important. If the Loan and the CMA are part of a single contractual relationship, WSFS’ argument that UDI’s alleged material breach of the Loan excuses performance under the CMA gains traction.\n1. contract interpretation\nIt is a well settled under Delaware contract law, that the best evidence of the parties’ intent is the written contact. Paul v. Deloitte & Touche LLP, 974 A.2d 140, 145 (Del.2009) (explaining that court must look to the “four corners of the contract to conclude whether the intent of the parties can be determined from its express language”).\nIt is the duty of a Court to give effect to the intentions of the parties to a contract, the writing being the embodiment of a jural act by the parties. In well-drawn and unambiguous contracts ... the plain meaning of the words used by the parties will be given full force and effect, and extrinsic evidence will not be admitted.\nSchwartz v. Centennial Ins. Co., 1980 WL 77940, at *5 (Del.Ch. Jan. 16, 1980) (citations omitted); accord Northwestern Nat’l Ins. Co. v. Esmark, Inc., 672 A.2d 41, 43 (Del.1996); Tenneco Auto. Inc. v. El Paso Corp., 2002 WL 453930, at *1 (Del.Ch. Mar. 20, 2002).\nA further axiom of contact interpretation is that related agreements are to be read together as one contract. Ashall Homes Ltd. v. ROK Entm’t Grp. Inc., 992 A.2d 1239, 1251 (Del.Ch.2010); accord In re Northwestern Corp., 313 B.R. 595, 601 (Bankr.D.Del.2004) (“all related documents and instruments in a single transaction together are harmonized to the extent possible”). “[T]he principle that all writings which are part of the same transaction are interpreted together also applies when incorporation by reference of another writing may be inferred from the context surrounding the execution of the writings in question.” Williston on Contracts § 30:26 (4th ed. (rev.) 2007) (“Williston”); accord CA, Inc. v. Ingres Corp., 2009 WL 4575009, at *47 (Del.Ch. Dec. 7, 2009); Simon v. Navellier Series Fund, 2000 WL 1597890, at *7 (Del.Ch. Oct. 19, 2000).\n2. integration\nWhere one party to a contract seeks to vary the terms of a written contract, the parol evidence rule is implicated. The parol evidence rule states “where parties have reduced their ultimate agreement to writing, the writing cannot thereafter be varied or contradicted.” McGrew v. Vanguard Corp., 1979 WL 4635, at *3 (Del.Ch. Sept. 25, 1979); accord Taylor v. Jones, 2002 WL 31926612, at *3 (Del.Ch. Dec. 17, 2002). The application of the parol evidence rule operates to exclude “an antecedent or contemporaneous oral understanding to vary or contradict the terms of a written contract.” Brandywine Shoppe, Inc. v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., 307 A.2d 806, 809 (Del.Super.Ct.1973).\nRelated to the parole evidence rule is the concept of contract integration. A distinction exists between contracts that are totally integrated and those only partially integrated:\nWhere the writing is intended to be final and complete, it is characterized as a total integration and may be neither contradicted nor supplemented by evidence of prior agreements. But where a writing is intended to be final but is in fact incomplete it is said to consist of a partial integration and although such a writing may not be contradicted by evidence of prior agreements, it may be supplemented by additional consistent evidence.\nMcGrew, 1979 WL 4635, at *3 (footnote omitted).\nIn determining whether the contract is fully or partially integrated, courts consider several factors, including whether the contact contains a merger or integration clause, the length and detail of the contract, the formality of the setting, and whether the contract is a form. See 6-25 Peter Linzer, Corbin on Contacts § 25.7 (Joseph M. Perillo, ed.) (Matthew Bender 2015) (“Corbin”); see also Hynansky v. Vietri, 2003 WL 21976031, at *3 (Del.Ch. Aug. 7, 2003); Taylor, 2002 WL 31926612, at *3.\nOnce it has been established that a contract is not fully integrated, the court may consider extrinsic or parol evidence regarding whether the parties intended to include other terms or agreements in the contract to supplement (but not vary or contradict) the written terms of the contract. Corbin § 25.7; see also Brandywine Shoppe, 307 A.2d at 809.\nIn this proceeding, I must apply these principles to determine whether the Loan and the CMA were each fully integrated, independent contracts or whether each was only partially integrated and supplemented by the provisions of the other.\n3. the Loan and CMA each were only partially integrated\nThe inclusion of an integration clause in a written contract is evidence that a contract is fully integrated, but by itself, is not conclusive. Li v. Standard Fiber, LLC, 2013 WL 1286202, at *7 n. 57 (Del.Ch. Mar. 28, 2013); MicroStrategy Inc. v. Acacia Research Corp., 2010 WL 5550455, at *13 (Del.Ch. Dec. 30, 2010). In this matter, the Loan has an integration clause, (see Ex. W-14, WSFS 00270, BLA ¶ 6.8), but it is not possible at summary judgment, to determine whether the CMA has one.\nThe Note expressly incorporates the BLA, (Note, Preamble) and refers to the BLA and the other Loan Documents as one collective transaction or one interrelated instrument. (Ex. W14, WSFS 00276, Note ¶ 3(a)). More to the point, the Note specifically provides that UDI must maintain its primary deposit account and cash management relationship with WSFS and the failure to do so constituted an event of default. (Id., WSFS 00278, Note ¶ 6(d); see also id., WSFS 00264, BLA ¶ 4.1 (k)). This requirement merged the lending and banking relationships.\nIt is therefore readily apparent that the CMA was only one (1) part of the larger transaction which included WSFS’ agreement to lend UDI $5 million for working capital. The Trustee has offered no extrinsic evidence to dispute that the Loan and CMA were two (2) parts of a single package.\nThese undisputed facts establish that the Loan and CMA both were only partially integrated. Each writing was the final manifestation of the agreements on the subjects addressed within each agreement. However, neither one, standing alone, represented the parties’ complete agreement. Each agreement supplemented the other, together forming a single integrated transaction. Consequently, the Loan and CMA must be interpreted together as parts of a single contract.\nB. Trustee’s Claim for Breach of Express Contract Provisions (Count Two)\nThree (3) elements are required to establish breach of contract under Delaware law: (1) the existence of a contract whether express or implied; (2) the breach of an obligation imposed by that contract; and (3) the resultant damage to the plaintiff. VLIW Technology, LLC v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 840 A.2d 606, 612 (Del.2003); eCOMMERCE Indus., Inc. v. MWA Intelligence, Inc., 2013 WL 5621678, *13 (Del. Ch. Sept. 30, 2013); In re Mobilactive Media, LLC, 2013 WL 297950, at *14 (Del. Ch. Jan. 25, 2013). The plaintiff has the burden to establish these elements by a preponderance of the evidence. Mobilactive Media, 2013 WL 297950, at *14; La-Point v. AmerisourceBergen Corp., 2007 WL 2565709, at *9 (Del.Ch. Sept. 4, 2007).\n1. WSFS Non-Performance under the CMA was excused by UDI’s material breach of the Loan\na.\nThe Trustee’s first argument under Count Two is that WSFS breached the CMA through the implementation of the PND and other actions that restricted UDI’s use of services that were provided under the CMA. The Trustee also makes the related argument that WSFS committed a breach of its express contractual duties by failing to perform all of its obligations under the CMA without prior notice. In response, WSFS asserts that it was excused from fully performing under the CMA due to UDI’s material breach of its obligations under the Loan Documents.\nWSFS is correct on the law. “A party is excused from performance under a contract if the other party is in material breach thereof.” BioLife Solutions, Inc. v. Endocare, Inc., 838 A.2d 268, 278 (Del. Ch.2003) (citing Moore Bus. Forms v. Cordant Holdings Corp., 1998 WL 71836, at *8 & n. 35 (Del.Ch. Feb. 6, 1998, revised Mar. 5, 1998)); accord Daystar Const. Mgmt., Inc. v. Mitchell, 2006 WL 2053649, at *7 (Del.Super. July 12, 2006).\nBased on this legal principle, if UDI materially defaulted under the Loan, it is appropriate to treat the default provisions of the Loan as either terminating WSFS’ ongoing obligations under the CMA or at least modifying those obligations to relieve WSFS of the obligation to perform those CMA obligations that were inconsistent with or that would undermine the efficacy of its loan default remedies. As stated earlier, the CMA and the Loan were two (2) parts of a single, integrated transaction. It would be illogical to construe the transaction documents as permitting WSFS to declare a default under the Loan Documents and exercise its default and collection remedies only to have the exercise of those remedies trigger a breach of its obligations under the CMA. See GMG Capital Invs., LLC v. Athenian Venture Partners I, L.P., 36 A.3d 776, 779 (Del. 2012) (“The meaning inferred from a particular provision cannot control the meaning of the entire agreement if such an inference conflicts with the agreement’s overall scheme or plan.” (citing E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., 498 A.2d 1108, 1113 (1985))).\nConsequently, the merits of the Trustee’s breach of contract claim boils down to two (2) questions:\n(1) Was UDI in default of the Loan?\n(2) If so, was the default material?\nBased on the undisputed facts, the answer to both questions is “yes.” The summary judgment record establishes as a matter of law that UDI was in material breach of the Loan Documents at the time WSFS took action after discovering the existence of the Red Notice. Therefore, WSFS was authorized to accelerate the Loan and was not required to strictly perform all of its obligations under the CMA and did not breach its contractual duties to UDI.\nb.\nThe BLA identifies fourteen (14) “Events of Default.” (Ex. W-14, WSFS 00266-00267, BLA ¶ 5.1(a)-(n)). WSFS has established on this record that at least two (2) events of default under the BLA occurred before it exercised its loan default remedies.\nOne event of default occurred under Paragraph 5.1(h) of the BLA, which states that the following constitutes an event of default: “[UDI] makes any material false or misleading statement, certificate, representation or warranty to [WSFS].”\nAmong the representations and warranties that UDI made to WSFS in the BLA were that:\n• the financial statements that UDI and Singh delivered to UDI were true and correct and presented their financial position fairly accurately and completely;\n• UDI had disclosed in writing all facts that could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition or any loan collateral; and\n• UDI was not obligated under any guaranty other than a guaranty in favor of WSFS.\n(Id., WSFS 00261, BLA ¶ 3.1(e), (f), (g)).\nWSFS has produced evidence, unrebut-ted by the Trustee, that UDI made the following misrepresentations to WSFS:\n• UDI submitted false financial statements which overstated UDI’s cash position by more than $2 million and its net worth by over $3.3 million;\n• UDI falsely represented that there were no inter-company balances;\n• UDI falsely represented that it had no guarantee obligations, when it had $32 million in guarantee obligations;\n• UDI failed to disclose significant losses caused by environmental factors at the Duncan gas stations which was the subject of a lawsuit at the time.\nAnother event of default occurred under Paragraph 5.1(b) of the BLA, which states that the following constitutes an event of default: the occurrence of an “Event of Default” under any of the other Loan Documents. An event of default occurred under another one of the Loan Documents: specifically, Paragraph 7 of the Guaranty.\nParagraph 7 of the Guaranty provided that an event of default occurs if any information given by Singh or UDI in connection with the Loan is not accurate in all material respects or if either Singh or UDI “omitted to state any material fact or any fact necessary to make such information not misleading.” In the Certificate of Guaranty Singh submitted to WSFS, Singh falsely certified that “[t]here is no suit, action, or proceeding pending, or threatened against or affecting the Guarantor before or by any court, administrative agency, [or] other governmental authority.” (Ex. W-14, WSFS 00332, Certificate of Guarantor ¶ 3).\nSingh’s failure to disclose the existence of the litigation against him in India and the Red Notice (in the name of his undisclosed alias, Batra) constituted an event of default under the Guaranty and therefore under Paragraph 5.1(b) of the BLA.\nc.\nThe next question is whether UDI’s default under the Loan Documents, on account of the material misrepresentations regarding UDI and Singh’s financial condition and the failure to disclose the Red Notice and the pending criminal charges in India against Singh, were material breaches that excused further strict contractual performance by WSFS. I conclude they were.\nThe determination whether a breach is sufficient to excuse further performance under a contract is one of degree. Preferred Inv. Servs., Inc. v. T & H Bail Bonds, Inc., 2013 WL 3934992, at *11 (Del.Ch. July 24, 2013). A material breach is action or inaction that goes to the root or “essence of the agreement between the parties, or ... which touches the fundamental purpose of the contract and defeats the object of the parties in entering into the contract.” Id. It must be “of sufficient importance to justify by the non-breaching party.” Biolife Solutions, 838 A.2d at 278.\n“A misrepresentation is material if it would be likely to induce a reasonable person to manifest his assent, or if the maker knows that it would be likely to induce the recipient to do so.” Restatement § 162(2); accord Alabi v. DHL Airways, Inc., 583 A.2d 1358, 1362 (Del.Super.Ct.1990). Further, a party may assert that its nonperformance is excused by the other party’s material breaches, even if it was not aware of those breaches at the time it terminated or modiñed its performance under the parties’ contract. See, e.g., Eastern Elec. & Heating, Inc. v. Pike Creek Professional Ctr., 1987 WL 9610, at *5 (Del.Super.Ct. Apr. 7, 1987); see also Schiavello v. Delmarva Sys. Corp., 61 F.Supp.2d 110, 114 (D.Del.1999) (after-acquired evidence of resume fraud is complete defense, to breach of contract claim); Davenport Group MG, L.P. v. Strategic Inv. Partners, 685 A.2d 715, 724 (Del.Ch. 1996) (later-discovered information of wrongdoing is defense to wrongful discharge suit).\nThe determination of materiality is usually a question of fact. Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Basell USA Inc., 512 F.3d 86, 92 (3d Cir.2008) (citing Saienni v. G & C Capital Group, Inc., 1997 WL 363919, at *3 (Del.Super.Ct. May 1, 1997)); 23 Willi-ston § 63:3. However, the materiality determination does not always preclude summary judgment. “[I]f the issue is disputed ... [but] there is only one reasonable conclusion, a court must address what is ordinarily a factual question as a question of law.” 23 Williston § 63:3; accord Nor folk, 512 F.3d at 92 (applying Delaware law); Saienni 1997 WL 363919, at *2, 3.\nHere, consistent with its usual underwriting practices, before it entered into the lending relationship with UDI, WSFS required that UDI and Singh provide financial statements and related financial information.. (Ex. W-19, Foley Dep. at 6-9). WSFS analyzed this information in the form of a credit memo presented to its Senior Loan Committee, which assessed UDI’s financial strength and the risk of extending credit. Based upon the information and risk analysis contained in that memo, WSFS granted UDI the Loan. (See Ex. W-37, Kocher Dep. at 18-19).\nThe Credit Memo referred specifically to UDI’s cash position of $2.1 million as “sufficient.” (Ex. W-31, WSFS 00530). As for Singh, UDI representatives required his guaranty before the Credit Memo was submitted to the Senior Loan Committee. (See W-37; Kocher Dep. at 20). At the Senior Loan Committee level, the Credit Memo separately analyzed the financial status of Singh, its guarantor. (Ex. W-31, WSFS 00532).\nThis record establishes, as a matter of law, that the misrepresentations in UDI’s financial disclosures substantially contributed to WSFS’ extension of credit under the Loan. Alabi, 583 A.2d at 1363 (“A misrepresentation induces a party’s manifestation of assent if it substantially contributes to his decision to manifest his assent.” (citation omitted)); see also Kirchner v. Stief, 2001 WL 1555313, at *3 (Del.C.P.2001) (“It is assumed, in absence of facts showing the contrary, that the recipient attached importance to the truth of the misrepresentation ...” (quoting Alabi, 583 A.2d at 1363)). In fact, the BLA itself states that the financial and related covenants induced WSFS to make the Loan to UDI.\nSimilarly, as a matter of law, Singh’s nondisclosure of the pending proceedings against him in India, was a material breach of his contractual disclosure obligations under the Guaranty. The record demonstrates that WSFS made the Loan largely on the strength of its confidence in UDI’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow. (See Ex. W-31, Credit Mem.; Ex. W-37, Kocher Dep. at 28). UDI’s financial strength, in turn, was based on its success as a functioning cog in the Universal Network. The Credit Memo confirms that WSFS was well aware that Singh was the principal of all of the key Universal Network entities. In these circumstances, it is obvious that WSFS’ decision to grant the loan necessarily depended on its confidence in Singh as the principal of UDI and the other Universal Network entities. See Ronald J. Mann, Article: The Role of Secured Credit in Small-Business Lending, 86 Geo. L.J. 1, at *6, 23-24 (Oct.1997) (discussing lenders’ uniform practice of securing personal guarantee and describing guarantee as “a major force” in small business lending where “the most important effect of the guaranty is not the direct enhancement of the creditor’s right to collect payment forcibly, but is instead the improvement of the borrower’s incentives”); see also David Hahn, Personal Bankruptcy in the 21st Century: Emerging Trends and New Challenges: Velvet Bankruptcy, 7 Theoretical Inq. L. 523, 531-32 (July 2006) (banks’ demand for personal guarantees is “a contractual bypass of the legal principle of limited liability” which serves as a “bonding device that combats the perils of excessive risk-taking at the corporate level”). This renders material the nondisclosure of the prior legal proceedings against him in India and the existence of the Red Notice international arrest warrant, nondisclosures that constituted events of default under Paragraph 7 of the Guaranty and Paragraph 5.1 of the BLA. See RTP LLC v. ORIX Real Estate Capital, Inc., 2014 WL 4414512, at *7-8 (N.D.Ill. Sept. 8, 2014) (holding guarantor’s failure to disclose lawsuit, in which court imposed a temporary restraining order was material breach under loan agreement).\nIn short, WSFS having established that UDI was in material breach of the Loan at the time that WSFS discovered the existence of the Red Notice, the Trustee cannot succeed on his claim for express breach of WSFS’ contractual obligations under the CMA.\n2. WSFS did not commit a breach of contract by failing to give prior notice before exercising its remedies under the Loan Documents\nThe Trustee also argues that WSFS committed a breach of contract by failing to give UDI prior notice before it exercised its Loan default remedies. The argument is without merit.\nThe express terms of the BLA provided WSFS with the right\' to accelerate the Loan without a declaration of default and without notice to UDI. (Ex. W-14, WSFS 00267, BLA ¶ 5.2(a), (b)). The Trustee seeks to vitiate the effect of this express contractual provision, arguing that the notice provisions in the Loan Documents are ambiguous because some of the remedial provisions require that notice be given to UDI while others are silent on the subject. (Tr. Reply Mem. at 5). Based on this purported ambiguity, the Trustee invokes the doctrine of contra proferentum and asks the court to construe the notice provisions against the drafter of the contract. He requests the court to read into the provisions of the Loan Documents that lack an express prior notice requirement, a duty to provide prior notice before exercising default remedies. (Id. at 5-6).\nAs a general rule, contract terms should be given their plain and ordinary meaning. E.g., AT & T Corp. v. Lillis, 953 A.2d 241, 252 (Del.2008); 11 Williston § 32.3. A contract term or provision is ambiguous only “[w]hen the provisions in controversy are fairly susceptible of different interpretations or may have two or more different meanings.” GMG Capital Invs., 36 A.3d at 780 (quoting Eagle Indus, v. DeVilbiss Health Care, 702 A.2d 1228, 1232 (Del.1997)); accord Rhone-Poulenc Basic Chem. Co. v. Am. Motorists Ins. Co., 616 A.2d 1192, 1196 (Del.1992). However, a contract is not ambiguous simply because the parties do not agree on its proper meaning. GMG Capital Invs., 36 A.3d at 780.\nIn the event of an ambiguity, sometimes courts will “adopt the meaning that is less favorable in its legal effect to the party who chose the words ... [a] technique known ... as ‘contra proferentem.’ ” 5-24 Corbin § 24.27; accord 11 Williston § 32:12. Under Delaware law, courts may apply this principle if alternative formulations indicate that the ambiguous provision could easily have been made clear by the drafting party. Twin City Fire Ins. Co. v. Delaware Racing Ass’n, 840 A.2d 624, 630 (Del.2003) (citing Kaiser Alum. Corp. v. Matheson, 681 A.2d 392, 399 (Del.1996)).\nIn his submission, the Trustee did not go through the Loan Documents and identify those remedies that require prior notice and flesh out the ambiguity he claims exists. Presumably, he is referring to ¶ 6(a) and (b) of the Note, which require fifteen (15) days prior notice before WSFS declares certain monetary defaults. Interestingly, the very next subparagraph of the Note, ¶ 6(c), authorizes WSFS to declare a default without notice in the event of a materially adverse change in UDI’s financial condition or with respect to the collateral of the Loan. In any event, there is no ambiguity in the provisions of the Loan Documents.\nThe Trustee’s argument fails because there is no contractual ambiguity on the subject of prior notice.\nThe BLA expressly states that WSFS may accelerate the Loan without a declaration of default and exercise its default remedies without notice to UDI. (Ex. W-14, WSFS 00267, BLA ¶ 5.2(a), (b)). The existence of a generally applicable provision, stating that notice is not required for declaration of a default and the exercise of a party’s remedies, with another provision imposing a notice requirement before a default may . be declared based on a certain, specific ground, does not create an ambiguity. As the Restatement points out, the specific may control over the general, but only in the context in which it is found in a contract; it does not replace or supersede the general contract provision:\n[I]n case of conflict the specific or exact term is more likely to express the meaning of the parties with respect to the situation than the general language ... [but if] the specific or exact can be read as an exception or qualification of the general, both are given some effect.-\nSee Restatement § 203, cmt. e.\nHere, there is neither an internal conflict within the BLA nor a direct conflict between the BLA and another one of the Loan Documents. WSFS declared a default and exercised its default remedies based on a non-monetary default for which there is no express contractual duty to give prior notice. The fact that there are other events of default as to which there is a duty to give notice does not create an ambiguity or vitiate WSFS’ express right to act without notice following a non-monetary default.\nAccordingly, the Trustee has not identified any specific contract provision mandating prior notice with which WSFS failed to comply.\nC. Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (Count One)\nThe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing requires contracting parties to “ ‘refrain from arbitrary or unreasonable conduct which has the effect of preventing the other party to the contract from receiving the fruits’ of the bargain.” Dunlap v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 878 A.2d 434, 442 (Del.2005) (emphasis added) (quoting Wilgus v. Salt Pond Inv. Co., 498 A.2d 151, 159 (Del.Ch.1986)); accord Nemec v. Shrader, 991 A.2d 1120, 1126 (Del.2010). Breaching the covenant may create liability for parties whose “conduct frustrates the ‘overarching purpose’ of the contract by taking advantage of their position to control implementation of the agreement’s terms.” Dunlap, 878 A.2d at 442 (citing Breakaway Solutions, Inc. v. Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc., 2004 WL 1949300 *12 (Del.Ch. Aug. 27, 2004)). The doctrine may be used to imply contract terms, “whether employed to analyze unanticipated developments or to fill gaps in the contract’s provisions.” Dunlap, 878 A.2d at 441 (footnote omitted).\nThe Delaware Supreme Court has emphasized the limited nature of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. A contracting party’s reliance on the express terms of an agreement does not amount to bad faith merely because such reliance “simply limits advantages to another party.” Nemec, 991 A.2d at 1128. Therefore, applying the implied covenant to find that a party breached its obligations by the manner in which it employed an express contractual right is a “cautious enterprise.” Id. at 1125 (citing Dunlap, 878 A.2d at 441). This is necessarily so because a plaintiff “generally cannot base a claim for breach of the implied covenant on conduct authorized by the agreement.” Id. at 1125-26.\nApplication of the implied covenant involves a “rare and fact-intensive exercise,” Dunlap, 878 A.2d at 442 (quoting Cincinnati SMSA Ltd. Partnership v. Cincinnati Bell Cellular Systems Co., 708 A.2d 989, 992 (Del.1998)), to be employed “[o]nly when it is clear from the writing that the contracting parties ‘would have agreed to proscribe the act later complained of ... had they thought to negotiate with respect to that matter,’ ” Dunlap, 878 A.2d at 442 (quoting Katz v. Oak Industries, Inc., 508 A.2d 873, 880 (Del.Ch. 1986)).\nStated slightly differently, and consistent with the contractual foundation of a claim for breach of an implied contractual duty,\nDelaware’s implied duty of good faith and fair dealing is not an equitable remedy for rebalancing economic interests after [subsequent] events ... adversely affected one party to a contract. Rather the covenant is a limited and extraordinary legal remedy.\neCOMMERCE Indus., 2013 WL 5621678, at *33 (citing Nemec, 991 A.2d at 1128).\nA claim arising from a breach of the implied covenant is itself contractual in nature. NAMA Holdings, LLC v. Related WMCLLC, 2014 WL 6436647, at *16 (Del.Ch. Nov. 17, 2014) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Thus, the elements of the claim are the same as those for an ordinary breach of contract claim, the only difference being that contractual obligation breached is implied, not express. See NAMA Holdings, 2014 WL 6436647 at *16 (quoting Fitzgerald v. Can tor, 1998 WL 842316, at *1 (Del.Ch. Nov. 10, 1998)). The implied covenant is not met by “[g]eneral allegations of bad faith conduct.” Kuroda v. SPJS Holdings, LLC, 971 A.2d 872, 888 (Del.Ch.2009). Instead, Delaware courts require the plaintiff to identify a specific implied obligation and to demonstrate that the breach of that obligation “denied the plaintiff the fruits of the contract.” Id.\nAs explained in Part V.B. above, following a material breach by UDI, WSFS exercised its default remedies under the Loan. Based on the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the Trustee argues that the manner in which WSFS implemented its default remedies was unreasonable and in bad faith. He contends that WSFS breached the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing by placing the administrative freeze on UDI’s accounts, sequestering $5 million to an internal account for the purpose of setting off the Loan, and failing to give notice to UDI of the administrative freeze and the sequestration of funds.\nThe Trustee’s contention, that WSFS’ conduct was arbitrary and unreasonable, is not supported by the undisputed facts in the record.\nFor the few days the PND was in effect, WSFS\' continued to honor requests for transfers and otherwise made funds available to UDI. The PND only removed automation from the process, thereby enabling WSFS to manually ensure there were available funds in the accounts sufficient to cover the transfers (and to stop payment if the available funds were insufficient). (Ex. W-7, Brogan Dep. at 78-79, 82). The net effect was that the PND merely stopped the automatic funding of outgoing transfers with provisional or advance credit. WSFS had the right to do this in light of UDI’s material breach of the parties’ contract.\nThus, there is no evidence that UDI lacked all access to its funds. Rather, from July 15 to July 22, 2009, UDI transferred over $11 million from its accounts (not including the $5 million used to repay the WSFS Loan). (Ex. W-7, Brogan Dep. at 81-83; Ex. W-8, Roberts Report at 4, 23-24; Ex. W-12, Manderino Dep. at 113, 116-118). More specifically, in the week after WSFS discovered the Red Notice, WSFS permitted UDI to withdraw from its accounts: $3 million, sent to UEI; $5.8 million, sent to UMI and sixty-seven (67) payments to . third parties totaling $212,000.00. (See Ex. W-12, Manderino Dep. at 117-118). In this regard, it is most telling that there is nothing in the record that suggests that UDI attempted to write checks or otherwise effect transfers from its accounts to non-Universal Network third parties and was unable to do so between July 16, 2009 and July 19, 20Q9, the dates the PND restriction was in effect.\nThus, the. uncontroverted facts demonstrate that UDI’s accounts were not entirely frozen and that millions of dollars flowed through them while the PND restriction was in place. WSFS continued processing transactions in and out of UDI’s accounts, albeit at a slower pace and without the automatic grant of provisional credit for all transactions provided under the terms of the CMA. In effect, the PND did little more than temporarily suspend UDI’s ability to take advantage of the provisional credit facility within the CMA. And, the Trustee made no showing that the segregation (and ultimately, the set-off) of the $5 million resulted in a default on any particular obligation by UMI, UDI or any other entity within the Universal Network.\nAs for the Trustee’s claim that WSFS’ actions without prior notice was a distinct breach of its contractual obligations, the Loan Documents imposed no duty on WSFS to give such notice. Nor did WSFS keep UDI in the dark about the limitations imposed on the CMA for very long. On July 17, 2009 — one day after the PND went into effect — WSFS gave notice to UDI (through its counsel) that it had: (a) put the PND in place, (b) segregated the $5 million, and (c) intended to set off the $5 million against the Loan.\nAside from the Trustee’s over-spin of the factual history, WSFS’ conduct was entirely consistent with the terms of the parties’ agreement. In the event of default, the Loan provided that WSFS could, without notice, set off the Loan against amounts in UDI’s depository accounts. The Loan was conditioned on the CMA being at WSFS and would not have been granted otherwise. Having its cash management system at WSFS was specifically designed to give WSFS security with respect to the Loan. What occurred was exactly what WSFS bargained for before it entered into its commercial relationship with UDI.\nIn short, WSFS did not overreact; its response to the disturbing information it received about the principal of its customer was not disproportionate. WSFS’ conduct was a measured response to its reasonable suspicion that UDI materially defaulted under the Loan Agreement because the principal of a borrower that was transferring large sums of cash on a daily basis was an international fugitive operating under an assumed name. WSFS administered the PND in a manner that was restrictive enough to protect its interests and no more. The undisputed facts depict bank conduct that is far below the “arbitrary” or “unreasonable” standard required in a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. No reasonable factfinder could find otherwise.\nVII. WSFS IS ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE TRUSTEE’S CLAIM UNDER 6 Del. C. § 4A (COUNT THREE)\nA. 6 Del. C. § 4A-305\nArticle 4A governs electronic funds transfers, specifically payment orders. See 6 Del. C. §§ 4A-101, et. seq. Generally, a payment order is “an instruction of a sender to a receiving bank, transmitted orally, electronically, or in writing, to pay, or to cause another bank to pay, a fixed or determinable amount of money to a beneficiary.” § 4A—103 (a) (1).\nArticle 4A defines several of the relevant terms used to describe a payment order. A sender is “the person giving the instruction to the receiving bank.” § 4A-103(a)(5). The receiving bank is “the bank to which the sender’s instruction is addressed.” § 4A-103(a)(4). A beneficiary bank is “the bank identified in a payment order in which an account of the beneficiary is to be credited pursuant to the order or which otherwise is to make payment to the beneficiary if the order does not provide for payment to an account.” § 4A-103(a)(3). A beneficiary is “the person to be paid by the beneficiary’s bank.” § 4A-103(a)(2).\nIn essence, a payment order can be broken down into a chain of transactions that may either be “accepted” or “rejected” at any point in the chain. For instance, a receiving bank may either accept or reject a payment order that the sender transmits. “[A] receiving bank ... accepts a payment order when it executes the order.” § 4A-209(a). A rejection occurs when the receiving bank issues a notice to the sender either orally, electronically, or in writing that indicates that the receiving bank “is rejecting the order or will not execute or pay the order.” § 4A-210(a). Once a payment order is accepted it may not then be later rejected and vice versa. See Banque Worms v. BankAmerica Int\'l 77 N.Y.2d 362, 568 N.Y.S.2d 541, 570 N.E.2d 189, 195 (1991) (“Payments made by electronic funds transfers in compliance with the provisions of article 4A are to be the equivalent of cash payments, irrevocable except to the extent provided for in article 4A”).\nA payment order is executed by a receiving bank when “it issues a payment order intended to carry out the payment order received by [that] bank.” 1-2 Benjamin Geva, The Law of Electronic Funds Transfers § 2.03[2] (Matthew Bender 2015) (quoting U.C.C. § 4A-301(a)).\nSection 4A-305 governs a receiving bank’s liability for late or improper execution or failure to execute payment order. It provides:\n(a) If a funds transfer is completed but execution of a payment order by the receiving bank in breach of Section 4A-302 results in delay in payment to the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to pay interest to either the originator or the beneficiary of the funds transfer for the period of delay caused by the improper execution. Except as provided in subsection (e), additional damages are not recoverable.\n(b) If execution of a payment order by a receiving bank in breach of Section 4A-302 results in (i) noncompletion of the funds transfer, (ii) failure to use an intermediary bank designated by the originator, or (iii) issuance of a payment order that does not comply with the terms of the payment order of the originator, the bank is liable to the originator for its expenses in the funds transfer and for incidental expenses and interest losses, to the extent not covered by subsection (a), resulting from the improper execution. Except as provided in subsection (c), additional damages are not recoverable.\n(c) In addition to the amounts payable under subsections (a) and (b), damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express written agreement of the receiving bank.\nB. The CMA\nOne of the documents executed by the parties as part of the CMA was the Funds Transfer Services Rider (“the FTS Rider”). (Ex. W-38, WSFS 01535-01545). Section 2 of the FTS Rider listed eight (8) services regarding payment orders to be paid through the cash management system. All of the services were worded in terms of “may” as opposed to shall. For instance, in the execution of payment orders, WSFS may execute each order received by it in the name of UDI as sender, provided that UDI had sufficient available funds on deposit in an account. (See Id., WSFS 01535, FTS Rider ¶ 2.1). The FTS Rider also provided that WSFS may reject any order that does not comply with the Services Agreement or funds transfer rules and security procedures. (Id., WSFS 01535-01536, FTS Rider ¶ 2.2).\nThe FTS Rider described the notice required if a payment order was not executed. If WSFS rejected or failed to execute an order of UDI, then WSFS was obligated to give notice to UDI by no later than the close of business on the execution date of the order. (Id.).\nSection 3 of the FTS Rider defined the fees, compensation, and costs associated for the services. The FTS Rider allowed WSFS to directly debit any of UDI’s accounts without prior notice for any fees, charge-backs, return fees for checks, drafts, payment orders or other payments owing to WSFS. (Id., WSFS 01537-01538, FTS Rider ¶ 3.1).\nWSFS was required to pay UDI if it rejected or failed to execute an order if, on the execution date of the order, there was a sufficient available balance in UDI’s account to pay for the order. (Id., WSFS 01538, FTS Rider ¶ 3.3). WSFS also was required to compensate UDI for the use of funds at the rate specified in ¶ 3.1.\nC. Discussion\nIn Count Three, the Trustee claims that WSFS intentionally failed to execute the First and Second TD Bank Transfer Orders with the intent of taking the funds, for its own benefit, (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 115, 118), giving rise to a claim under 6 Del. C. § 4A-305.\nWSFS raises several grounds for the entry of summary judgment in its favor on Count Three. First, WSFS argues that due to UDI’s material contract breach, WSFS had no obligation to execute the orders under the CMA, and therefore no liability under § 4A-305. (WSFS Mem. at 86). Second, WSFS contends that there is no dispute that WSFS actually executed the orders, but then reversed them. (Id. at 87). Lastly, WSFS argues that the FTS Rider gave WSFS discretion to execute the orders and UDI did not have sufficient collected available funds as required. (Id. at 86-87). WSFS’ second argument provides the rule of decision on Count Three.\nThe undisputed facts establish that WSFS executed the First and Second TD Bank Transfer Orders. TD Bank, the beneficiary bank in this transaction, accepted the orders and credited UMI’s account at TD Bank. The funds transfer was completed.\nIt is also undisputed that WSFS requested TD Bank to return the First and Second TD Bank Transfer Orders. TD Bank honored WSFS’ request that the First TD Bank Transfer Order be reversed, but refused the request as to the Second Transfer Order.\nThe Trustee’s claim fails because once a payment order is accepted it may not be rejected. By definition, neither Transfer Order was rejected.\nArticle 4A allows recovery under certain narrow circumstances. This fact situation before me does not fit the provisions of the statute. Further, a review of the case law, reveals no decision on point to support the Trustee’s legal theory. Therefore, the Trustee may not recover under Article 4A for a post-completion revocation of a completed payment order.\nTo the extent the Trustee complains about the revocation of the Second TD Bank Transfer Order, there is no remedy under Article 4A. I do not decide whether another provision of the U.C.C. provides a remedy or whether the transaction might state a cause of action under another area of state law. The Trustee has not raised an alternative cause of action.\nSummary judgment should be entered in favor of WSFS and against the Trustee on Count Three of the Second Amended Complaint.\nVIL WSFS IS ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE TRUSTEE’S FRAUDULENT TRANSFER CLAIMS (COUNTS SIX AND SEVEN)\nA. The Trustee’s Claims Are Based Solely on Constructive Fraud\nIn Count Six and Seven, the Trustee asserts claims for fraudulent transfers pursuant to 11-56-U.S.C. §§ 544 and 548. Although the Trustee recites the “actual intent” provisions of 6 Del. C. §§ 1804(a)(1) (for purposes of § 544) and 11 U.S.C. § 548(a)(1)(A), he has not presented any argument or evidence in support of a claim for intentional fraud. In these circumstances, I do not consider the Trustee to be pressing any claim that UMI, UDI or WSFS participated in any scheme that was intentionally designed to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. Therefore, I limit my analysis of Counts Six and Seven to the Trustee’ constructive fraud claim.\nB. Summaiy of the Parties’ Positions\nThe transfers at issue are the following: (1) the initial UMI-UDI Transfers and (2) the Setoff (ie., UDI’s involuntary transfer to WSFS that paid off the Loan). Collectively, I will refer them as the “Transfers.”\nThe Trustee offers two (2) legal theories that the Transfers were constructively fraudulent.\nFirst, the Trustee argues that the UMI-UDI Transfers went directly to WSFS. The Trustee contends that WSFS was the “initial transferee” because it exercised dominion and control over UDI’s depository accounts by placing the PND restriction on UDI’s accounts before taking the funds for its own benefit — even though the UMI-UDI Transfers were deposited initially into UDI’s account before WSFS moved the money to the general ledger account and subsequently satisfied the Loan. (Tr. Mem. at 78). The Trustee further emphasizes that WSFS controlled the disposition of other monies in the UDI Accounts, including reversing and returning items previously attempted to be paid out by UDI (ie., the Second TD Bank Transfer). (Tr. Mem. at 79). Under this initial transferee theory, the Trustee asserts that he may recover the Transfers because there was no consideration for the Transfers. There was no consideration because UMI owed no money to WSFS and WSFS provided no value to UMI (which was insolvent\'at the time) in return for the $5 million that it received.\nThe Trustee’s alternative legal theory is that he may recover the Transfers from WSFS as a subsequent transferee. The basis for this position is quite conventional. He contends that UMI did not receive reasonably equivalent value for the transfers it made to UDI.\nWSFS disputes every aspect of the Trustee’s theory. As a threshold issue, WSFS argues that the Trustee has not identified the Transfers with specificity. Next, WSFS contends that not only was UDI the initial transferee, but also there was value supporting both the inbound transfers from UMI to UDI and the subsequent outbound transfers from UDI to WSFS (the consideration in the second transfer being repayment of an antecedent debt). Finally, WSFS contends that the Transfers made in satisfaction of UDI’s outstanding debt (¿a, the Loan) were in good faith and without knowledge of their avoidability. See 11 U.S.C. § 550(b)(1).\nC. Constructive Fraud: Applicable Legal Principles\n1. 11 U.S.C. § 548\nFor a constructive fraud claim, 11 U.S.C. § 548(a) provides:\n(a)(1) The trustee may avoid any transfer ... of an interest of the debt- or in property ... that was made ... within 2 years before the date of the filing of the petition, if the debtor voluntarily or involuntari-iy-\n* * *\n(B) (I) received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation; and\n(ii) (I) was insolvent on the date that such transfer was made or such obligation was incurred, or became insolvent as a result of such transfer or obligation;\n(II) was engaged in business or a transaction, or was about to engage in business or a transaction, for which any property remaining with the debtor was an unreasonably small capital;\n(III) intended to incur, or believed that the debtor would incur, debts that would be beyond the debtor’s ability to pay as such debts matured; or.\n(IV) made such transfer to or for the benefit of an insider, or incurred such obligation to or for the benefit of an insider, under an employment contract and not in the ordinary course of business.\nIn most proceedings, this constructive fraudulent transfer statutory verbiage can be distilled down to four (4) elements:\n(1) the debtor had an interest in the property;\n(2) the interest was transferred within two years of the filing of his bankruptcy petition;\n(3) the debtor received less than equivalent value in exchange for the transfer; and\n(4) either:\n(I) the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transfer; or\n(ii) became insolvent as a result thereof; or\n(iii) intended to incur, or believed that he would incur, debts that would be beyond his ability to pay them as they became matured.\nSee, e.g., In re Dawley, 2005 WL 2077074, at *14 (Bankr.E.D.Pa. Aug. 10, 2005).\nThe party challenging the transfer bears the burden of proving all of the elements of a constructive fraudulent transfer claim. See, e.g., In re Fruehauf Trailer Corp., 444 F.3d 203, 211 (3d Cir. 2006); In re Plassein Int’l Corp., 405 B.R. 402, 411 (Bankr.D.Del.2009), aff\'d, 428 B.R. 64 (D.Del.2010).\nFrequently in § 548(a)(1)(B) litigation, the most heavily litigated issue is the third element: whether the debtor received reasonably equivalent value in the transaction. In this Circuit, courts employ a two (2) step process in determining whether a debtor received reasonably equivalent value in the form of indirect economic benefits in a particular transaction:\n(1) whether any value is received, and\n(2) whether that value was reasonably equivalent to the transfer made.\nIn re R.M.L., 92 F.3d 139, 152 (3d Cir.1996); Plassein Int’l Corp., 405 B.R. at 411; see also In re Fid. Bond & Mortg. Co., 340 B.R. 266, 287 (Bankr. E.D.Pa.2006), aff\'d, 371 B.R. 708 (E.D.Pa. 2007). Because the purpose of the fraudulent transfer statute is to protect creditors, the court determines whether value was received from the vantage of the creditor. Fid. Bond & Mortg., 340.B.R. at 286. The inquiry is “what did the debtor give up and what did it receive that could benefit creditors.” Id. (citing In re Joy Recovery Tech. Corp., 286 B.R. 54, 75 (Bankr.N.D.Ill. 2002)).\nIn this determination, “value ... include[s] any benefit ... whether direct or indirect.” Fruehauf Trailer Corp., 444 F.3d at 212 (citation omitted); Mellon Bank, N.A. v. Metro Communications, Inc., 945 F.2d 635, 646-47 (3d Cir.1991); In re Vaso Active Pharm., Inc., 2012 WL 4793241 (Bankr.D.Del., Oct. 9, 2012). The\' “touchstone” in the determination is whether the parties exchanged comparable “realizable commercial value.” Mellon Bank, 945 F.2d at 647. Thus, if a debtor’s “realizable going concern value after the transaction is equal to or exceeds its going concern value before the transaction, reasonably equivalent value has been received.” Id.\nIn the reasonably equivalent value inquiry, courts look to the totality of the circumstances, considering such factors as “(1) whether the transaction was at arm’s length, (2) whether the transferee acted in good faith, and (3) the degree of difference between the fair market value of the assets transferred and the price paid.” Plassein Int’l Corp., 405 B.R. at 411; accord Fid. Bond & Mortg., 340 B.R. at 287 (citing R.M.L., 92 F.3d at 145, 153). If a court concludes that the benefits the debtor received “are minimal and certainly not equivalent to the value of a substantial outlay of assets,” a plaintiff need not prove the exact value conferred because the “amount” of value is then irrelevant. Fruehauf Trailer Corp., 444 F.3d at 214.\n2. 11 U.S.C. § 544(b) and 6 Del. C. §§ 1304, 1305\n11 U.S.C. § 544(b)(1) provides that “the trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable under applicable law by a creditor holding an unsecured claim that is allowable under section 502.... ” Section 544(b) allows the Trustee to step into the shoes of an actual creditor who existed at the commencement of the bankruptcy case, and avoid the fraudulent transfers pursuant to state law.\nThe Trustee invokes 6 Del. C. §§ 1304 and 1305 of the Delaware fraudulent transfer statute as applicable state law under § 544(b).\n6 Del. C. § 1304 provides:\n(a) A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor, whether the creditor’s claim arose before or after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation: * * *\n(2) Without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation, and the debt- or:\na. Was engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction; or\nb. Intended to incur, or believed or reasonably should have believed that the debtor would incur, debts beyond the debtor’s ability to pay as they became due.\n6 Del. C. § 1305 provides:\n(a) A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor whose claim arose before the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation and the debtor was insolvent at that time or the debtor became insolvent as a result of the transfer or obligation.\n(b) A transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor whose claim arose before the transfer was made if the transfer was made to an insider for an antecedent debt, the ■ debtor was insolvent at that time and the insider had reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent.\nIn order to prevail under the Delaware constructive fraud transfer provisions, the Trustee must establish that:\n(1) the debtor made a transfer;\n(2) for less than reasonably equivalent value; and\n(3) the debtor was, or was rendered^ insolvent thereby.\nIn re Delta Petroleum Corp., 2015 WL 1577990, *18 (Bankr.D.Del. Apr. 2, 2015) (citing Brandt v. Trivest II, Inc. (In re Plassein Int\'l Corp.), 2008 WL 1990315, *5 (Bankr.D.Del. May 5, 2008)).\nD. WSFS Was Not an “Initial Transferee” of the UMI Transfers\nThe Trustee’s lead theory hinges on the notion that WSFS was the initial transferee (i.e., the direct recipient) of the UMI-UDI Transfers.\nSignificantly, the concept of an “initial transferee” does not derive from the avoidance sections of the Bankruptcy Code. Rather, it is derived from 11 U.S.C. § 550, the Code provision that addresses a trustee’s ability to recover property after establishing that a transfer is avoidable. Section 550 of the Code provides, in pertinent part:\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, to the extent that a transfer is avoided under section 544, 545, 547, 548, 549, 553(b), or 724(a) of this title, the trustee may recover, for the benefit of the estate, the property transferred, or, if the court so orders, the value of such property, from—\n(1) the initial transferee of such transfer or the entity for whose benefit such transfer was made; or\n(2) an immediate or mediate transferee of such initial transferee.\n11 U.S.C. § 550(a).\nSection 550(a) does not define the term “initial transferee,” however. In the absence of a clear statutory definition, courts have developed standards for determining whether a party is an “initial transferee.”\n1. The Bonded Financial Services and Incomnet Tests\nMost courts, including a number of circuit courts of appeal, have concluded that mere initial receipt of a transfer does not always equate to initial transferee status. See 4 Norton Bankr.L. & Prac. 3d § 70:2 (West 2015).\nIn Bonded Fin. Servs. v. European Am. Bank., 838 F.2d 890, 893 (7th Cir.1988) (emphasis added), the court explained:\nAlthough the Bankruptcy Code does not define “transferee,” and there is no legislative history on the point, we think the minimum requirement of status as a “transferee” is dominion over the money or other asset, the right to put the money to one’s own purposes.\nThe standard articulated in Bonded is known as the “dominion-and-control test,” and has been widely adopted. See In re Hurtado, 342 F.3d 528, 533 (6th Cir.2003) (following In re Finley, Rumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson & Casey, 130 F.3d 52, 57 (2d Cir.1997)).\nIn In re Incomnet, Inc., 463 F.3d 1064 (9th Cir.2006), the Ninth Circuit articulated a distinction between “dominion” and “control.” The focus of the dominion standard is “whether an entity had legal authority over the money and the right to use the money however it wished.” Id. at 1070. The transferee has dominion if it has “the right to put the money to one’s own purposes.” Id. (internal quotations and citation omitted). In contrast, the “control” standard may involve a broader, more flexible approach, in which the courts look at the entire transaction as a whole to evaluate which party truly had control of the money. Id.\nThe Incomnet court described the two (2) tests as “similar, [but] not indistinguishable.” Id. at 1071. The dominion test focuses on legal title and the transferee’s right to use the funds as it sees fit; the control test “takes a more gestalt view of the entire transaction to determine who ... controlled the funds in question.” Id\nAfter articulating the distinction between “dominion” and “control,” the In-comnet court clarified that, in prior cases, the Ninth Circuit had adopted the dominion test to the exclusion of the control test. Id. at 1071 (citing In re Cohen, 300 F.3d 1097, 1102 n. 2 (9th Cir.2002)); see also In re Mortgage Store, Inc., 773 F.3d 990, 996 (9th Cir.2014) (reaffirming the “dominion” test articulated by Incomnet).\nThe Third Circuit has not adopted any specific test. The parties differ as to the proper test the court should employ to evaluate this issue.\nThe Trustee argues that this court should employ the combined “dominion and control test,” set forth in Bonded Financial and focus on the transferee’s relationship to the property. (Tr. Mem. at 74 (citing Perrino v. Salem, Inc., 243 B.R. 550, 561 (D.Me.1999)). In other words, in the case of funds held in an account, the Trustee urges the court to determine\' the terms under which the funds are held and to ascertain the debtor’s interest in said funds. “Funds may not be the-property of the party in whose account such funds reside, if such depositor’s use of those funds is so restricted that he cannot control their use or disposition.” (Tr. Mem. at 74-75 (citing In re Bank of New Eng., 165 B.R. 972, 977 (Bankr.D.Mass.1994))).\nWSFS views both the facts and the law differently. WSFS recommends application of the “dominion” test, as set forth by Incomnet. WSFS argues that it never exercised dominion over the transfers from UMI (and, thus, cannot be an initial transferee) because it had no legal right to use those funds. WSFS describes the PND restriction as merely “a privileged cautionary measure [that] limited [WSFS’] discretionary provision of credit to UDI under the Cash Management Services Agreement.” (WSFS Mem. at 119; Doc. # 206). Citing to Citizens Bank of Maryland v. Strumpf 516 U.S. 16, 116 S.Ct. 286, 133 L.Ed.2d 258 (1995), WSFS claims that such an act of temporary suspension is not an act of dominion. (WSFS Mem. at 120). “Suspension is not even denial of any level of control of the funds, since WSFS’s obligations to UDI were not denied — merely frozen to protect them from the automatic debits in the electronic funds transfer system.” (Id.). As to the $5 million applied to satisfy UDI’s loan, WSFS characterizes this as a subsequent transaction; simply a transfer from the UDI deposit account to a ledger account, with WSFS’s $5 million obligation to UDI as a deposit customer remaining intact. Accordingly, WSFS argues that UDI was the initial transferee when it received the funds from UMI, and took title and dominion over them. Only after UDI had dominion over those funds, did WSFS exercise its right to apply the funds to UDI’s Loan indebtedness. Thus, according to WSFS, WSFS was only a subsequent transferee of the UMI-UDI Transfer, not the initial transferee from UMI.\n2. WSFS was not the initial transferee because it lacked dominion or control over the UDI accounts\nBased on my review of the record, I agree with WSFS and conclude that the undisputed facts establish that WSFS lacked dominion or control over the UDI accounts sufficient to establish that WSFS was an initial transferee under § 550(a). Contrary to the picture drawn by the Trustee, the measures taken by WSFS between July 16 through July 19, 2009 did not absolutely restrict all outgoing transfers from UDI’s account.\nMost significantly, there is no evidence of any legal title change to the funds in UDI’s accounts. Nor is there any indication that UDI was utterly helpless and without access to funds. As detailed in Part V.B., supra, for the few days the PND was in effect, WSFS continued to honor requests for transfers and otherwise made funds availablé to UDI. The PND merely suspended the funding of outgoing transfers with provisional or advance credit without review.\nTherefore, I conclude that WSFS did not have the requisite dominion or control over UDI’s accounts to render it an “initial transferee” of the UMI-UDI Transfers. WSFS was a subsequent transferee.\nE. WSFS Is Not Liable as a Subsequent Transferee of the UMI-UDI Transfer\nHaving determined that WSFS was a subsequent transferee of the UMI-UDI Transfers, I now must evaluate the corollary issue: whether, as a result of the Setoff, WSFS was the recipient of a fraudulent transfer as a subsequent transferee.\nIn this scenario, the Trustee must establish that UMI did not receive reasonably equivalent value for the transfers UMI made to UDI and that WSFS is liable as a subsequent transferee. See II U.S.C. §§ 548(a)(1)(B) and 550(a)(2). For the following reasons, I find the Trustee has not met his burden his burden of proof.\nThe Trustee argues that UMI received no value for the transfers they made to UDI because UMI provided goods and services to UDI—ie., there was no reason for UMI to transfer money to UDI. (Tr. at 68, n.27; Tr. Reply at 30-31). The Trustee posits that the funds should have flowed the other direction, ie., from UDI to UMI. (Tr. Mem. at 68, n.27). As WSFS points out, however, it was the Trustee’s burden to produce evidence demonstrating the lack of reasonably equivalent value. The Trustee has failed to submit any evidence other than his supposition that UDI did not provide value to UMI.\nMoreover, in pressing for summary judgment, WSFS has not relied solely on the shortfall in the Trustee’s case. WSFS also offered evidence that the Transfers were made in exchange for value. WSFS documented $1.7 million of UDI credit card sale receivables that UMI collected during July 2009 and owed to UDI. Further value to UMI and UEI was provided in the form of liquidity obtained through the cash management services WSFS provided to UDI. (WSFS Reply at 28). WSFS also offered evidence that UMI owed an obligation to UDI on account of receivables it was collecting on UDI’s behalf. (See Ex. 76, Bohnert Dep. at 185-86).\nThe Trustee has not quantified the inadequacy of any value UDI received from UMI, as is his burden. The only evidence in the summary judgment record is that the UMI-UDI Transfers were supported by some value. Thus, the Trustee lacks evidentiary support for a necessary element of his claim. In these circumstances, WSFS is entitled to summary judgment on this claim. See Polichuk, 506 B.R. at 423 (“the appropriate time for demonstrating that there is evidence that supports every element of ... the Trustee’s claims (in response to the contention that no such evidence exists) is now, at summary judgment”) (internal quotations omitted).\nVIII. WSFS IS NOT ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE TRUSTEE’S SETOFF CLAIM UNDER 11 U.S.C. § 553(b) (COUNT EIGHT)\nA. The Trustee’s § 553(b) Claim is Dependent on the Nunc Pro Tunc Extension of Substantive Consolidation to WSFS\nIn Count Eight, the Trustee invokes 11 U.S.C. §§ 553(b) and 550 and seeks to avoid WSFS’ $5 million Setoff against UDI’s bank accounts.\nSection § 553(b) provides:\n(b)(1) Except with respect to a setoff of a kind described in section 362(b)(6), 362(b)(7), 862(b)(17), 362(b)(27), 555, 556, 559, 560, 561, 365(h), 546(h), or 365(i)(2) of this title, if a creditor offsets a mutual debt owing to the debtor against a claim against the debtor on or within 90 days before the date of the filing of the petition, then the .trustee may recover from such creditor the amount so offset to the extent that any insufficiency on the date of such setoff is less than the insufficiency on the later of—\n(A) 90 days before the date of the filing of the petition; and\n(B) the first date during the 90 days immediately preceding the date of the filing of the petition on which there is an insufficiency.\n(2) In this subsection, “insufficiency” means amount, if any, by which a claim against the debtor exceeds a mutual debt owing to the debtor by the holder of such claim.\'\n11 U.S.C. § 553(b).\nSection 553 allows a trustee to avoid the amount of its improvement in position within 90 days of the petition date. The mechanics of determining whether a creditor improved its position by setoff during the 90 day period is as follows:\n[WJhere a setoff occurred within 90 days before the commencement of bankruptcy, the trustee ... may recover the amount of setoff to the extent of a reduction of the insufficiency within a certain time frame. “Insufficiency” is defined at § 553(b)(2) as the amount by which a claim against a debtor exceeds a mutual debt owing to the debtor by the holder of such claim. Under § 553(b), the amount [of] the setoff [that] may be recovered is determined by comparing the insufficiency in existence 90 days before the filing (or, if later, the first date on which there was an insufficiency) with the insufficiency on the date of setoff. The trustee ... is entitled to recover the amount by which the former amount exceeds the latter.\nIn re Aspen Data Graphics, Inc., 109 B.R. 677, 684 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1990) (citations omitted).\nNinety (90) days prior to the setoff, the Trustee contends that there was an “insufficiency” in excess of $5.75 million. (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 218). On the day that WSFS setoff the Loan, there was no insufficiency; the setoff paid off the indebtedness.\nThe Trustee’s § 553(b) claim is dependent upon achieving substantive consolidation of UDI’s estate with the existing bankruptcy estate as to WSFS. As explained in Part III.A., supra, the court’s order substantively consolidating UMI and UDI provided that the order would not “impact any rights concerning WSFS,” thereby excepting WSFS from its effects. As to WSFS, the order provided that UDI would be treated as having filed a bankruptcy petition on August 4, 2010 in a case jointly administered (but not substantively consolidated) with UMI’s bankruptcy case.\nIf August 4, 2010 is employed as the petition date, the Trustee’s claim is doomed because WSFS’ July 2009 setoff occurred far outside the ninety (90) day look back period of 11 U.S.C. § 553(b)(1)(A). Hence, in this adversary proceeding, the Trustee invokes the right reserved in the August 4, 2010 substantive consolidation order to seek extension of substantive consolidation to WSFS effective July 23, 2009 (the date UMI filed its bankruptcy petition). If UDI is treated as having filed a bankruptcy petition on July 23, 2009, the Trustee can satisfy the temporal ninety (90) day requirement m § 553(b).\nIn their memoranda, the parties sparred on the threshold issue whether, as a matter of law, the Trustee may even seek substantive consolidation as to WSFS.\nWSFS argues that the Trustee may not wield substantive consolidation offensively, i. e., as a stratagem to create a § 553(b) claim against WSFS. (WSFS Mem. at 88). WSFS relies on Owens Coming, 419 F.3d 195 (3d Cir.2005), and asserts that substantive consolidation cannot be used to create causes of action to the detriment of creditors or to alter creditors’ rights. WSFS also makes a more fact-specific based argument that it is being “singled out” by the Trustee and that such use of substantive consolidation is inappropriate and impermissible.\nThe Trustee responds that he is not singling out WSFS. The Trustee states that one aspect of the goal of substantive consolidation is to allow the estate to bring actions on behalf of the consolidated estates in order to bring assets back into the estate and for the benefit all creditors. The Trustee asserts that, from the outset, he sought substantive consolidation to create avoidance actions and raise an estate with the consolidated entities and that he merely deferred resolution of the issue as to WSFS.\nOn this threshold issue, the Trustee is correct.\nB. Substantive Consolidation: General Legal Principles\nSubstantive consolidation is an equitable remedy. “It treats separate legal entities as if they were\' merged into a single survivor left with all the cumulative assets and liabilities (save for inter-entity liabilities, which are erased).” Owens Corning, 419 F.3d at 205 (quoting In re Genesis Health Ventures, Inc., 402 F.3d 416, 423 (3d Cir.2005)). The Third Circuit has described substantive consolidation as an “extreme” and “last-resort remedy” that “rais[es] the specter for some [creditors] of a significant distribution diminution.” Owens Corning, 419 F.3d at 206.\nOwens Coming created a black letter law test for substantive consolidation in which the proponent must prove: “(i) pre-petition [the entities to be consolidated] disregarded separateness so significantly their creditors relied on the breakdown of entity borders and treated them as one legal entity, or (ii) postpetition their assets and liabilities are so scrambled that separating them is prohibitive and hurts all creditors.” Id. at 211 (footnotes omitted).\nThe black letter law test is stated in general terms, leaving much to the exercise of the bankruptcy court’s discretion. The Owens court sought to guide the bankruptcy court by stating the following limiting principles to be considered when a party seeks substantive consolidation:\n(1) Absent compelling circumstances, state law, the Bankruptcy Code and commercial markets legitimately expect courts to respect the separateness of separate entities.\n(2) The harms that substantive consolidation addresses are nearly always those caused by debtors who disregard separateness.\n(3) Mere benefit to the administration of the case is not a harm that justifies substantive consolidation.\n(4) Substantive consolidation is extreme and imprecise — this rough justice should be rare and used as a last resort.\n(5) “While substantive consolidation may be used defensively to remedy the identifiable\' harms caused by entangled affairs, it may not be used offensively (for example, having a primary purpose to disadvantage tactically a group of creditors in the plan process or to alter creditor rights).”\nOwens Corning, 419 F.3d at 211.\nIt is the fifth legal principle quoted above that is the foundation of WSFS’ argument that extending substantive consolidation to it, at this time, is inappropriate. Respectfully, I disagree that the fifth legal principle controls the outcome here.\nC. Owens Corning Does Not Bar, As a Matter of Law, the Nunc Pro Tunc Extension of Substantive Consolidation to WSFS\nWSFS argues that I should consider the propriety of extending the substantive consolidation from the vantage point of July 18, 2011, the date the Trustee filed this adversary proceeding. Certainly, as of that date, WSFS can make a strong case that the Trustee’s request for substantive consolidation appears inconsistent with Owens Coming. It has the appearance of a litigation tool targeting a single creditor, rather than as a remedy designed to do equity among numerous parties. However, this argument fails to take into account the prior procedural history of this case.\nThe Trustee’s original motion for substantive consolidation encompassed WSFS. In the consolidation motion, the Trustee represented that a significant magnitude of inter-company transfers among the Affiliates occurred on a daily basis; assets of the companies were commingled; business records could not be reconciled without substantial expense; and certain large creditors relied upon the overall financial position of UMI effectively as a single entity. The factual circumstances alleged by the Trustee provided a facially plausible justification for substantive consolidation under Owens Coming.\nFurther, from the outset, the Trustee sought nunc pro tunc consolidation as a means to preserve claims under chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Trustee represented that the chapter 5 claims “would otherwise be unavailable as a potential avenue of recovery by the creditor body of the Universal Network” and that preservation alone “would clearly provide significant benefit to the creditors of the consolidated Universal Network entities.” (Goldstein Declaration ¶ 15; Bky No. 09-15404, Doc. # 318). The Trustee was not seeking to isolate an individual creditor or a discreet group for disparate treatment; instead, he was suggesting that the universe of transfer avoidance claims was a tool that should be available for the equitable administration of this chapter 7 case.\nAgainst this backdrop, no creditor objected to the Trustee’s substantive consolidation request except WSFS. The Trustee and WSFS then struck the bargain described earlier in this Opinion, in which substantive consolidation was effected (except for WSFS), UDI was deemed a jointly administered chapter 7 debtor as to WSFS as of August 4, 2010, and the parties reserved all of their respective rights to seek or contest further substantive consolidation. Presumably, the Trustee desired more time to investigate and weigh his options before embarking on what promised to be (and turned out to be) hotly contested, expensive litigation against WSFS. For its part, WSFS presumably hoped to avoid expending further resources litigating substantive consolidation issues that would be merely academic (as to WSFS) if the Trustee decided against filing adversary litigation against WSFS.\nIn effect, the parties’ agreed to defer the substantive consolidation dispute through a “standstill agreement.” To give effect to the parties’ agreement, it is necessary to treat this litigation as resuming the dispute when they declared a truce in August 2010. It follows that the issue should be considered as if no substantive consolidation had occurred as to any of the non-UMI entities. Thus, if the Trustee can make out the case now that would have allowed him to obtain substantive consolidation over WSFS’ objection as to all creditors (in 2010), he should be permitted to do so. To conclude otherwise would mean that, by obtaining substantive consolidation except as to WSFS in 2010, the Trustee did not preserve, but rather effectively waived, his right to later seek extension of substantive consolidation retroactive to July 23, 2009 as to WSFS. The parties’ agreement, as incorporated in the August 4, 2010 substantive consolidation order, is to the contrary.\nIn these circumstances, the parties’ agreement and fairness dictate that I now consider the extension of nunc pro tunc substantive consolidation to WSFS from the pre-substantive consolidation temporal vantage point of August 4, 2010. Accord In re Lower Bucks Hospital, 471 B.R. 419, 450 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.2012), aff\'d, 488 B.R. 303 (E.D.Pa.2013), aff\'d, 571 Fed.Appx. 139 (3d Cir.2014) (parties bound by agreement to allow chapter 11 plan to be confirmed and defer litigation of propriety and court approval of discreet plan provision without prejudice to their rights). It follows that WSFS’ argument that the extension of substantive consolidation constitutes an inappropriate “offensive” use of the doctrine is unpersuasive.\nIn sum, based on the particular circumstances of this case, I conclude that: (1) the Trustee’s request for nunc pro tunc extension of substantive consolidation as to WSFS should be considered on its merits, and (2) therefore, the Trustee’s setoff claim is not barred as a matter of law for failure to satisfy the ninety (90) day look back requirement of 11 U.S.C. § 553(b)(1)(A).\nD. The Setoff Claim is Not Ripe for Summary Judgment\nOther than debating the issue whether an attempted “offensive” use of substantive consolidation to create an avoidance claim against a single creditor barred its applicability in this case as a matter of law (thereby defeating the Trustee’s § 553(b) setoff claim), neither party discussed or marshaled the evidence generated in discovery on the questions whether the Trustee has or lacks evidence to support (1) substantive consolidation under Owens Coming and (2) the elements of a setoff claim under § 553(b) — in particular, whether the “insufficiency” decreased during the ninety (90) day period prior to the bankruptcy filing. In these circumstances, summary judgment on the Trustee’s setoff claim should not be granted because there are disputed issues of material fact.\nIX. MANNER OF DISPOSITION OF THE MOTIONS\nFor the reasons explained below, I cannot enter a final, dispositive order granting summary judgment to WSFS on Counts One, Two, Three, Six and Seven.\nA. Jurisdictional Overview\nAs stated in numerous reported opinions, bankruptcy subject matter jurisdiction is conferred by 28 U.S.C. § 1334(a) and (b) potentially extends to four (4) types of title 11 matters:\n(1) cases under title 11;\n(2) proceedings arising under title 11;\n(3) proceedings arising in a case under title 11; and\n(4) proceedings related to a case under title 11.\nSee, e.g., In re Combustion Engineering, Inc., 391 F.3d 190, 225-26 (3d Cir.2004). This jurisdiction is vested in the district court, but the district court has the authority to refer bankruptcy cases and proceedings to the bankruptcy court. 28 U.S.C. § 157(a). In this district, the district court has done so. See Standing Orders of the District Court dated July 25, 1984 and November 8,1990.\nAccording to the text of the Judicial Code, all bankruptcy matters, other than the bankruptcy case itself, may be classified into two (2) categories:\n(1) core proceedings arising under title 11; and\n(2) non-core proceedings that are otherwise related to a case under title 11.\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 157(b), (c); In re Mullarkey, 536 F.3d 215, 221 (3d Cir.2008).\nThe core/non-core distinction is significant because “[a] correct determination of whether a matter is core or non-core establishes the bankruptcy judge’s level of authority.” In re Seven Fields Dev. Corp., 505 F.3d 237, 254 (3d Cir.2007). The bankruptcy court has the statutory authority to determine all core matters. 11 U.S.C. § 157(b)(1); see generally In re Porter, 295 B.R. 529, 535 (Bankr.E.D.Pa. 2003). In a non-core proceeding, the bankruptcy court may not enter a final judgment, but may only submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court for de novo review, unless all parties agree that a final judgment may be entered by the bankruptcy court. See 28 U.S.C. § 157(c); Halper v. Halper, 164 F.3d 830, 836 (3d Cir.1999).\nIn 2011, the Supreme Court’s decision in Stem v. Marshall, created a third category of matters in the universe governing the division of authority between the district court and the bankruptcy court. In Stem, the Supreme Court held that Article III of the U.S. Constitution prohibits bankruptcy courts from issuing final orders in certain matters Congress classified as core in 28 U.S.C. § 157(b). Such claims (commonly referred to as “Stem” claims) are now treated in most, if not all, respects as non-core. See Wellness Int’l Network, — U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1932, 191 L.Ed.2d 911.\nThus, to determine the scope of its decision-making authority, the bankruptcy court must now undertake a two-step process. First, as it did prior to Stem, it must ascertain whether 28 U.S.C. § 157(b) designates a particular claim as core or non-core. Second, if the court determines the claim to be core (statutorily speaking), the court then must consider whether the claim is a Stem claim.\nIn this case, the Trustee has asserted that all of his claims are core. (Second Am. Compl. ¶3, Adv. No. 11-512, Doc. # 170). WSFS disputes this. (Answer to Second Am. Compl. ¶ 3, Adv. No. 11-512, Doc. # 176).\nB. All of the Claims to Be Dismissed are Either Non-Core or Stern Claims\nThe concept of a core proceeding is anchored in two (2) of the jurisdictional bases stated in 28 U.S.C. § 1334(b) for the exercise of bankruptcy jurisdiction. “[C]ore proceedings consist of two subsets: those that ‘arise under’ and those that ‘arise in’ the bankruptcy case.” Porter, 295 B.R. at 535. At bottom, “[c]ore proceedings represent those disputes that are so intertwined with the bankruptcy process that Congress has the power, under Article I of the Constitution, to direct a non-tenured judicial officer (i.e., bankruptcy judge) to render a final determination of their merits. Id.\nThe Court of Appeals has provided guidance for the determination whether a claim is core or non-core.\nIf the proceeding involves a right created by the federal bankruptcy law, it is a core proceeding; for example, an action by the trustee to avoid a preference. If the proceeding is one that would arise only in bankruptcy, it is also a core proceeding; for example, the filing of a proof of claim or an objection to the discharge of a particular debt. If the proceeding does not invoke a substantive right created by the federal bankruptcy law and is one that could exist outside of bankruptcy it is not a core proceeding; it may be related to the bankruptcy because of its potential effect, but under section 157(c)(1) it is an “otherwise related” or non-core proceeding.\nIn re Guild and Gallery Plus, Inc., 72 F.3d 1171, 1178 (3d Cir.1996) (quoting In re Wood, 825 F.2d 90, 97 (5th Cir.1987)); accord In re Exide Technologies, 544 F.3d 196, 206 (3d Cir.2008); Halper, 164 F.3d at 836. Of course, as part of the process of applying these principles, the bankruptcy court must consult the illustrative examples of core proceedings set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 157(b). See Exide Technologies, 544 F.3d at 206.\nNo extended discussion is necessary to explain why the Trustee’s first three (3) claims are non-core. These claims — (a) in contract, for breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, (b) for breach of contract, and (c) for violation of 6 Del. C. § 4A-305)—are not found in 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2) or title 11 of the U.S.Code. They all are grounded in applicable non-bankruptcy law and exist independently of any bankruptcy filing.\nThe remaining two (2) claims subject to dismissal (Counts Six and Seven) are fraudulent transfer claims. Congress has classified such claims as core proceedings. See 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(H). However, it also is necessary to evaluate whether they are Stem claims.\nThe reported opinions discussing whether a bankruptcy court has the constitutional authority to enter a final judgment in a fraudulent transfer action brought pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 544 or 548 are legion. See Construction and Application of United States Supreme Court Decision in Stern v. Marshall, 77 A.L.R. Fed. 2d 23, §§ 23-24 (West 2015). I will not burden this Opinion with a lengthy analysis of the issue. Suffice it to say that I agree with the court’s reasoning in In re InCl Auction & Appraisal Servs. LLC, 493 B.R. 460, 464-65 (Bankr.M.D.Pa.2013). In Int\'l Auction, the court held that the Supreme Court’s rationale in Stem, when combined with the Court’s prior holding that the right to recover fraudulent transfers is a “private right,” not a “public right,” see Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 109 S.Ct. 2782, 106 L.Ed.2d 26 (1989), compels the conclusion that the bankruptcy court lacks the authority to enter a final judgment in such matters.\nIn this bankruptcy case, where WSFS has not filed a proof of claim, and therefore resolution of the Trustee’s fraudulent transfer claims can have no impact on the court’s core function of allowing and disallowing claims against the bankruptcy estate, see Stern, 131 S.Ct. at 2616-17, this court lacks the authority to enter a final order with respect to those claims.\nC. The Limited Nature of this Court’s Order Resolving the Cross-Motions\nHaving determined that WSFS’ summary judgment motion should be granted, but that the bankruptcy court may not enter a final order dismissing Counts One, Two, Three, Six and Seven, what is the appropriate disposition of WSFS’ motion?\nThe issue is complicated by the fact that one (1) claim—Count Eight (11 U.S.C. § 553)—has survived summary judgment. Had I concluded that WSFS was entitled to summary judgment on all of the Trustee’s claims, I simply could have issued a report and recommendation to the district court for appropriate disposition of all of the Trustee’s claims. However, because the district court referred this adversary proceeding to this court and the proceeding has not concluded, it would be premature for the bankruptcy court to issue a report and recommendation to the district recommending dismissal of some, but not all, of the Trustee’s claims. Doing so would be the functional equivalent of permitting an interlocutory appeal of an order dismissing some, but not all, of a plaintiffs claims, in a proceeding in which the bankruptcy court has the authority to enter a final judgment. By analogy, that would run afoul of the strong policy against piecemeal appeals. See generally In re G-I Holdings, Inc., 2005 WL 3370020, at *5 (D.N.J. Dec. 9, 2005); see also Gold v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 723 F.2d 1068, 1072 (3d Cir.1983) (discussing sparing use of collateral order doctrine).\nMy solution to the problem is to issue an order that dismisses the Trustee’s claims (save Count Eight) for purposes of trial of this adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court. At the conclusion of the adversary proceeding in this court, I will issue a comprehensive Report and Recommendation to the district court for the entry of an appropriate order with respect to all of those claims in the proceeding as to which the bankruptcy court lacks authority to enter a final judgment. See In re Drauschak, 481 B.R. 330, 339 (Bankr. E.D.Pa.2012) (“when an adversary proceeding raises multiple claims, the various claims must be analyzed for bankruptcy jurisdictional purposes on a claim-by-claim basis” (citing Halper, 164 F.3d at 839)).\nX. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, I will deny the Trustee’s motion for summary judgment and grant WSFS’ motion for summary judgment in part by dismissing; for purposes of trial in the bankruptcy court Counts One, Two, Three, Six and Seven. Count Eight survives summary judgment and will proceed toward trial. An appropriate order follows.\nORDER\nAND NOW, upon consideration of the Trustee’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Defendant WSFS’ Cross Motion for Summary Judgment, and the parties’ accompanying memoranda of law in support of the respective Motions, and for the reasons set forth in the accompanying Opinion,\nIt is hereby ORDERED that:\n1. Counts One, Two, Three, Six and Seven are DISMISSED for purposes of trial in the bankruptcy court, subject to de novo review by the district court.\n2. WSFS’ Cross Motion is DENIED as to Count Eight.\nA status conference is SCHEDULED on December 9, 2015, at 10:00 a.m., in Bankruptcy Courtroom No. 1, 2d floor, U.S. Courthouse, 900 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA.\n. (Second Amended Complaint ¶ 87) (Adv. No. 11-512, Doc. # 170).\n. (Trustee Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment at 1) (Adv. No. 11-512, Doc. # 193) (“Tr.Mem.”).\n. In addition to UDI, other entities in the network included Universal Enterprises, Inc. (“UEI”), Universal Management, Inc., Universal Distribution Inc., and Project Growth Technologies, Inc.\n. UMI’s corporate secretary described the flow of money within the Universal Network as follows:\nTypically, accounts were structured at a given bank so that each of the SPEs maintained a checking account, into which collections from the corresponding Station would be deposited (the “SPE Accounts”). ... [A]t the end of each day, the SPE Accounts were ""swept"" into a “master account"" generally in the name of Universal Delaware. In other words, the SPE Accounts were set up to be “zero balance” ... accounts.\nCash needs of the Universal Network members were met by funding a given entity whenever it needed funds on hand, from whatever source was available — i.e., credit lines, inter-company ""loans,” or any other source. Money was constantly flowing to and from the various entities (including [UMI] and Affiliates) in the form of inter-company transfers. These inter-company transfers were made on a daily basis between and among [UMI] and the Affiliates, and were effected primarily for the purpose of maintaining liquidity where it was needed in the Universal Network at any given point in time. Moreover, the entities did not maintain formal records of these inter-company transfers — as “loans” or otherwise — beyond the bank statements themselves.\nThe magnitude of the inter-company transfers, on any given day, could amount to hundreds of thousands, and at times, millions, of dollars being shifted among the [UMI’s] and the Affiliates’ various bank accounts.\n(Declaration of Jashveer Singh; Bky. No. 09-15404, Doc. #319) (emphasis added). This affidavit was filed in April 2010 in connection with a contested matter in the main bankruptcy case.\n. The degree to which WSFS restricted transfers out of UDI\'s accounts is material to the outcome of this adversary proceeding and is discussed in Parts V. and VIL, infra.\n. When appropriate, citations to the record will include a reference to specific pages using Bate Stamp numbers.\n. Initially, Foley proposed a $4 million demand line on January 8, 2009. (Ex. W-35, WSFS 06108). The proposal was revised to $5 million on January 14, 2009. (Ex. W-36, WSFS 00653).\n. The Credit Memorandum explained the origin of UDI, its existence as a business operator of 36 retail gas stations and convenience stores, its relationship as a wholesale purchaser of motor fuel from UEI and the 100% ownership of UDI and UEI by Daniel Singh in both single name ownership and various family trusts. It also clarified, with respect to UEI, that “[a]lthough financial statements were not provided for this company, D & B reports annual sales of $185MM and profits of $5.0MM in 2006.” (Ex. W-31, WSFS 00528). This reference to UEI was a clerical error and was meant to refer to UMI. (Ex. W-28, Foley 2004 Examination at 54). WSFS corrected the erroneous reference to UEI in a subsequent credit request package made in June 2009, when UDI requested an additional loan of $2.1 million, which WSFS denied. (Ex. W-40, WSFS 00550).\n.Foley further explained: “We were looking at making a loan to Universal Delaware, Inc., which was a retailer of oil fuel. It didn\'t matter whether Universal Delaware, Inc. was buying from Universal Marketing, Inc. or some other wholesaler, they would have continued to operated just as successfully.” (Ex. W-28, Foley 2004 Exam, at 56).\n. The representations were set forth is several subsections of the BLA. Some were under the heading “Conditions” (id., WSFS 00529-00260, BLA UK 2.1-2.2), some were under the heading “Representations and Warranties” (id., WSFS 00260-00261, BLA ¶¶ 3.1-3.2), and some were under the heading ""Covenants,” (id., WSFS 00263-00266, ¶¶4.1-4.2).\n. The CMA appears to be a boiler plate type of agreement whereby the borrower checks off boxes for the desired cash management services it desires from WSFS. UMI elected seven (7) services:\n• ACH Debit Block/Filter;\n• Credit & Investment Sweep;\n• Business Internet Banking;\n• Positive Pay;\n• Funds Transfer;\n• Xpress Deposit;\n• Zero Balance Account.\n(Id., WSFS 01533).\n. The CMA stated that it was subject to the ""General Terms and Conditions Applicable to Cash Management Services” (""the General Terms and Conditions Attachment”) ""set forth after the signatures below” and any terms and conditions set forth in any rider, any exhibit or schedule to a rider, any addendum or modification that may be executed by the parties. (Id., WSFS 01533).\nIn discovery, WSFS produced a seven (7) page General Terms and Conditions Attachment. It provided that either party could terminate its obligations under the CMA on thirty (30) days notice. (Id., WSFS 01296, CMA Attachment ¶ 8(a)). But it also allowed WSFS to terminate the CMA immediately with or without prior notice in twelve (12) enumerated situations, including:\n• if ""any representation made or information provided by a Customer Party is false or misleading in any material respect when made or provided,” (id. ¶ 8(a)(viii);\n• upon “Customer’s] ... fail[ure] to comply with any of its obligations under these Terms or any one or more Service Agreements,” (id.) ¶ 8(a)(1);\n• WSFS, in its sole discretion, believing that its provision of any Service created a risk of financial loss for it, (id. ¶ 8(b)).\nThese provisions are important insofar as the Trustee’s claims are based, in part, on the lack of prior notice before WSFS exercised certain default remedies.\nSignificantly, however, the existence and authenticity of the General Terms and Conditions Attachment is in dispute. WSFS did not produce the General Terms and Conditions Attachment until the last day of discovery, alleging that it found the document belatedly on an internal computer drive. The Trustee considers these circumstances suspicious and disputes the authenticity of the document.\nI have not relied on the General Terms and Conditions Attachment in ruling on the pending motions.\n. Kocher testified that before approving additional credit facilities to UDI, he felt he needed more information as to how UDI used the existing credit facility. (Ex. W-37, Koch-er Dep. at 45-46). Kocher explained:\nIt specifically had to do with the use of our line of credit and the activity of that line given the nature of Universal Delaware\'s business. Universal Delaware’s business was portrayed as a retail operation that did not own the real estate, did not have much in terms of capital improvements or capital assets, and they consumed five million dollars in working capital in a business that is primarily cash driven and doesn\'t have a significant amount of inventory. That’s a lot of working capital. I believe I took the number of stores at some point and divided it into our line of credit and determined, hey, they have spent over $100,000 per store. How does that happen? It had everything to do with how is our borrower performing? The financial statements seemed strong, but the use of our credit facility did not match what the financial statements were portraying.\n(Id. at 48-49).\n. In a interoffice memo dated June 26, 2009 from Erin Crozier, a WSFS credit analyst, and Foley to Steve Clark, Loan Committee Secretary, the extension was deemed a “Minor Modification” because the line of credit to UDI was a demand, not a term, note. (Ex. W-19, Foley Dep. at 40-41). The explanation for the modification was provided in the \'\'Comments/Reason\'’ section of the memo:\nDuring the review period (3 months) the line had a high balance of $5.0MM and a low balance of $2.0MM. The line did not meet the requirement of 30 consecutive day rest period as it was just closed in March 2009. It is recommended that it be waived for this review period (3 months) and it will be reviewed again for the next 12 month period starting 6/30/09.\nThe 90 day extension is requested to allow more time to reevaluate the Borrower\'s financial statements.\n(Ex. W-44, WSFS 00541).\n. On July 14, 2009, an Indian-born teller at a WSFS branch recognized Singh as Batra, a man she knew from the local Indian community. (Ex. W-45, Conway Dep. at 15-16). It is not entirely clear whether it was Singh or a member of his family who went into the bank that day, but either way, that visit set in motion the events that resulted in the current litigation.\n. INTERPOL is the world’s largest police organization comprised of 190 member countries. INTERPOL, http://www.interpol.in1/ About-INTERPOL/Overview (last visited Nov. 10, 2015).\n. According to the INTERPOL website,\nINTERPOL Notices are international requests for cooperation or alerts allowing police in member countries to share critical crime-related information.\nNotices are published by INTERPOL’s General Secretariat at the request of National Central Bureaus (NCBs) and authorized entities ....\nIn the case of Red Notices, the persons concerned are wanted by national jurisdictions for prosecution or to serve a sentence based on an arrest warrant or court decision. INTERPOL’s role is to assist the national police forces in identifying and locating these persons with a view to their arrest and extradition or similar lawful action.\nINTERPOL, http://www.interpol.in1/ INTERPOL-expertise/Notices (last visited November 10, 2015) (emphasis added).\nAs further explained in the U.S. Attorneys’ Manual, a Red Notice “is the closest instrument to an international arrest warrant in use today.” Office of he United States Attorneys, http://www.justice.gov/us am/criminal-resource-manual-6 11 -interpol-red-notices (last visited November 10, 2015).\n.As WSFS explained in its brief:\nA PND restriction stops automated debiting of an account on uncollected funds, and creates a list of outgoing transfers initiated each day from the depositor’s accounts, so the bank can manually ensure that there are collected available funds and stop payment where there are not collected available funds. Otherwise, when a depositor has ACH capabilities, the transfers settle on an automated basis and may be processed by drawing on advance or provisional credit without review.\nThe PND restriction does not halt activity, as collected money will fund debits. The effect of the PND implemented by WSFS is that, if a depositor (like UDI) is determined to be a high risk customer, the PND stops the funding of outgoing transfers with provisional or advance credit without review, thereby protecting the bank from being an overdraft victim....\n(WSFS Memorandum of Law at 35-36 (""WSFS Mem.”) (citing Ex. W-7, Brogan Dep. at 78-82).\n. The Trustee muddled the summary judgment record by referring to his documentary exhibits (other than deposition transcripts) by what appears to be the designation given to them at the various depositions and then lumping numerous exhibits together (not always sequentially) in attachments to the Motion designated as Exhibits A-Z. Having burrowed through the filing, I will continue to use the Trustee’s term for referencing the exhibits.\n. For ease of reference, the term ""UMI-UDI Transfers” will include the transfers that UEI made to UDI in the same time period. Those transfers were:\nOn July 15, 2009:\n1. $2,840,000.00 from UMI at TD Bank into UDI (""First UMI Transfer”);\n2. $1,415,775.00 (aggregate sum) from UMI at TD Bank to UDI Account (""Second UMI Transfer”);\n3. $1,850,000.00 (aggregate sum) from UEI at Bancorp bank (""the First UEI Transfer”).\n(Trustee\'s Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment at ¶¶ 68-70).\nOn July 16, 2009:\n1.$2,925,000.00 from UMI at TD Bank into UDI (""the Third UMI Transfer”);\n2. $1,242,050.00 (aggregate sum) from UMI at TD Bank into UDI (""the Fourth UMI Transfer”)\n3. $1,400,000.00 (consisting of one or more checks) from UEI at Bancorp into UDI (""Second UEI Transfer”).\n{Id. at ¶¶ 78-80).\n. As explained in WSFS’ expert report:\nAfter WSFS verified that the Debtor Transfers were collected funds and no longer subject to return or reversal from the sending banks, WSFS properly made the funds available to its customer. During the time period in question, UDI withdrew over $16 million from its WSFS accounts, to pay a variety of parties, including UMI and UEI, while $5,000,000 was appropriately applied to repay the WSFS demand line.\n(Ex. W-8, Roberts Report at 4).\n. I recognize that the comparative statistics cited in the text are not perfectly parallel. The $11 million in Outgoing Transfers includes two (2) days of transfers after the PND was lifted, but I could locate nothing in the record that compiled the total of outgoing transfers while the PND was in effect. In any event, the Trustee does not dispute that the Outgoing Transfers occurred while the PND was in effect. (See, e.g., Ex. W-67, McDaniel 000455) (referencing outgoing wire transfers in excess of $3.0 million on July 20, 2009).\n. Based on the substantive consolidation order and a second substantive consolidation order, entered at the Trustee\'s request and without objection, the Trustee auctioned various properties titled in the name of various Universal entities. The sale proceeds reduced TD Bank\'s secured claim against UMI and the consolidated bankruptcy estate. Also, on behalf of the estate, the Trustee retained some of the sale proceeds based on a carve-out agreement with TD Bank. (See Bky No. 09-15404, Doc. #’s 488, 529).\n. Besides UDI, the Affiliates were the other entities referenced in note 3, supra: UEI, Universal Management, Inc., Universal Distribution Inc., and Project Growth Technologies, Inc.\n. The somewhat tortuous procedural history of the Rule 12(b) litigation in this adversary proceeding is outlined in the court’s order dated June 14, 2012. (Id., Doc. #43). It is unnecessary to repeat it here.\n.The four (4) dismissed claims were:\nCount Four — a claim for breach of fiduciary duty;\nCount Five — a claim for declaratory judgment that WSFS is no longer a secured creditor of UDI and is obligated to file a termination statement as to its UCC-1;\nCount Nine — a preference claim under 11 U.S.C. § 547;\nCount Ten — a request that the court disallow any claim of WSFS until or unless WSFS pays the amount of any transfers that are avoided in this adversary proceeding, see 11 U.S.C. § 502(j).\nCount Three (the claim pursuant to 6 Del. C. § 4A-305 for failure to execute two (2) payment orders) was not dismissed, but WSFS’ motion was granted insofar as the Trustee sought relief in the form of consequential damages.\n. [W]hen a movant contends a nonmovant lacks crucial evidence, this factual contention must be supported in the same manner as any other factual contention made in a summary judgment motion, by reference to disclosure and discovery materials, admissions, affidavits or declarations, and the like. The eviden-tiary support for this assertion probably does not have to be thorough and detailed as when a movant attempts to show that the facts are undisputed. Nonetheless, because the rule explicitly requires a ""showing,” there must be at least enough evidentiary support for the assertion that the nonmovant lacks crucial evidence to demonstrate the movant\'s good faith. The nonmovant and the court should not face the burdens imposed by a summary judgment when the movant has no basis for its assertion.\nPolichuk, 506 B.R. at 405 (quoting 11-56 Moore’s Federal Practice—Civil § 56.40[1](b)[iv] (LexisNexis 2013)) (emphasis omitted).\n. The BLA, the Note and the CMA each state that the agreement is governed by Delaware law. Neither party has questioned that proposition.\n. An integration clause is a statement in the parties\' written contract that the writing is intended to be the final expression of their agreement. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 209, cmt. b (“Restatement""); Middle-town Concrete Products, Inc. v. Black Clawson Co., 802 F.Supp. 1135, 1145-46 (D.Del.1992).\n. The integration clause states that the ""Loan Documents"" (the defined term encompassing the other documents executed in connection with the credit transaction) ""constitute the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the Loan.”\n. Conversely, a slight breach by one party to a contract will not terminate the obligations of the injured party to perform. Daystar Const., 2006 WL 2053649, at *7.\n.The integration clause in the CMA is part of the General Terms and Conditions Attachment. As stated earlier, see.n. 12, the Trustee disputes the authenticity of the General Terms and Conditions Attachment.\n. (Ex. W-16, Dovell Dep. at 33; Ex. W-17, Dovell Report at 8-11, 14-15).\n. (Ex. W-17 Dovell Report at 15-19).\n. (Ex. W-17, Dovell Report at 12-14; Ex. W-90, Manderino Report at 11).\n. I recognize that the environmental litigation involved a number of the properties owned by other Universal Network entities, not UDI. However, given UDI’s role as manager of numerous Universal Network entities, the litigation undoubtedly could have had an adverse impact on UDI’s business and financial condition (within the meaning of ¶ 3.1(e) of the BLA).\n. Separate and apart from the contractual analysis employed above in the text, (i.e UDI\'s material breach of express contractual provisions excused WSFS’ performance), Delaware law provides, more generally, that a contract may be voidable on the basis of misrepresentation, be it a fraudulent or an innocent misrepresentation. See Alabi, 583 A.2d at 1361. Such a misrepresentation may be asserted as an affirmative defense to a contract action. Id. In asserting misrepresentation as a defense, a party must establish that: (1) there was a misrepresentation; (2) the misrepresentation was either fraudulent or material; (3) the misrepresentation induced the recipient to enter into the contract; and (4) the recipient\'s reliance on the misrepresentation was reasonable. Id. at 1361-62 (citing Restatement § 164); Tekstrom Inc. v. Savla, 2006 WL 2338050, at *5 (Del.Super.Ct. July 31, 2006).\n. In his initial brief, the Trustee argued that WSFS breached the CMA by WSFS’ failure to give notice required by the CMA before altering its performance of its CMA obligations. That argument fails for the reasons expressed in the immediately preceding Part V.B.l, supra. The Trustee has no claim for breaches of the CMA due to UDI’s prior material breaches of the Loan.\nIn his Reply brief, the Trustee put forward a variation on that argument. He asserted, for the first time, that WSFS’ exercise of its loan default remedies in a manner that bleached its CMA obligations were taken in breach of WSFS’ prior notice obligation under the Loan Documents. (Tr. Reply Mem. at 5-6). I address this argument in the text below.\n. The Trustee’s argument also fails because the doctrine of contra proferentem is not applied where both parties have contributed to the drafting of a contract. See Sodano v. Am. Stock Exch. LLC, 2008 WL 2738583, at *13 n. 71 (Del.Ch. July 15, 2008), aff\'d sub nom., Am. Stock Exch. LLC v. Fin. Indus. Regulatory Auth., Inc., 970 A.2d 256 (Del.2009). WSFS produced evidence that the notice provisions of the contracts were negotiated by counsel. (See Ex.W-9, Ryan Dep. at 106, 109). The doctrine of contra proferentem is not applicable in these circumstances.\n. To illustrate, previously accepted outbound ACH transfers from UDI to UMI were honored and other activity on UDI\'s deposit accounts proceeded at substantial levels after the PND restriction was put in place. This included $2,361,800.00 transferred from UDI to UMI on July 17, 2009 and $1,925,000.00 to UEI\'on July 20, 2009. (See Ex. 110, July 2009 ACH Payments Account Statement at WSFS 00987) (transfers to UMI highlighted in yellow); Ex. 112, UDI July 2009 Corporate Check Payments Statement, at WSFS 01400-06) (check drawn highlighted in pink)).\n. In fact, thirteen (13) UDI checks totaling over $15,000.00 issued to third parties posted on July 17, 2009. (Ex. W-ll, GOL-WSFS 389302).\n. The Trustee’s Expert Report of Dan Schechter (Tr. Reply Mem., Ex. A) concluded that WSFS did not act in conformity with prevailing standards and practices within the commercial lending industry. The Report assumes that WSFS was required to declare a default and give notice to UDI under the ■ Loan, that WSFS unqualifiedly froze UDI\'s accounts when it instituted the PND, and that WSFS did not verify the Red Notice prior to setting off the Loan. The undisputed facts establish that the Trustee\'s version of the actions WSFS took upon discovery of the Red Notice are simply incorrect or vastly over simplified. As a result, the Schechter Report does not address the factual scenario presented in this proceeding and creates no issue of fact that prevents the entry of summary judgment.\n. Paragraph 5.2 of the BLA authorized . WSFS to exercise every remedy granted under the Loan Documents. Paragraph 7(b) of the Note authorized WSFS to exercise any rights available to it under the UCC or any applicable law. WSFS’ actions were consistent with the UCC and applicable Delaware law. See 6 Del. C. §§ 9-109(d)(10) (stating Article 9 does not apply to a right of setoff with two exceptions), 9-340 (set-off against deposit accounts), 9-404 (defenses or claims of an account debtor); see also Webster v. Beebe, 1 Boyce 314, 24 Del. 314, 317, 76 A. 54 (Del. 1910) (discussing common law right to setoff under Delaware law); Davis v. 913 North Mkt. St. Pshp., 1996 WL 769326, *2 (Del.Super.Ct. Dec. 12, 1996) (same).\n. Generally, the reasonableness of WSFS\' actions is a fact issue that would be decided at trial. However, I conclude that no trier of fact could find that WSFS’ conduct was unreasonable, arbitrary or in bad faith. In these circumstances, a court may grant summary judgment. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (summary judgment standard is ""very close” to directed verdict standard where both inquire whether ""the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law”); Curley v. Klem, 499 F.3d 199, 210 (3d Cir.2007) (judge may decide issue of reasonableness once all historical facts are no longer in dispute); see also Mundell v. DBA/ DMC Mining Servs. Corp., 2014 WL 7911147, at *4 (M.D.Pa. Apr. 2, 2014) (making mixed-fact law determination at summary judgment based on undisputed historical facts).\n. The Trustee requested ""consequential damages, compensatoiy damages, direct and indirect damages, punitive damages, setoff, recoupment, credits, interest, costs of suit, attorneys’ fees and legal expenses, and for such other and further relief that the Court deems just, proper, and equitable” for WSFS’s failure to execute the First and Second TD Bank Transfer Orders. (Second Am. Compl. ""wherefore clause,” at 24). However, the Trustee’s request for consequential damages was dismissed for purposes of trial by the Order entered June 15, 2012 (Adv. No. 11-512, Doc. #43), and the Trustee did not seek leave to amend Count Three in its Motion to Amend the First Amended Complaint. Thus, the Trustee\'s request for damages under Count Three is limited to ""expenses in the transaction and for incidental expenses and interest losses resulting from the failure to execute.” {Id.).\n. The Trustee cited the ""actual intent” provisions in both the Second Amended Complaint and his motion for summary judgment.\n. The concept that the record recipient of a transfer may not be the initial transferee also finds expression in the related “conduit theory” doctrine. An entity that receives a transfer may not be a ""transferee” at all, but only a ""mere conduit” if the transfer is for the limited purpose of allowing the entity to pass the asset through to another party. ""The key characteristic of a conduit is that the person or entity is under a contractual or other obligation to use the transferred funds or assets for the benefit of a third party and may not put those funds or assets to its own use.” Polichuk, 506 B.R. at 450.\n. The Incomnet court also observed that ""[a] number of circuits combined these tests — or at least combined their names — creating a ‘dominion and control test’ to determine whether a party is an initial transferee.” 463 F.3d at 1071.\nIn a slight variation, the Eleventh Circuit applies the ""conduit or control” test as an “equitable exception” to the literal or rigid interpretation of the statutory term ""initial transferee,"" most commonly thought of as the first recipient of fraudulently-transferred funds. In re Harwell, 628 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2010). In Harwell, the circuit court added ""good faith” as an element of the equitable exception:\n[I]nitial recipients of the debtor\'s fraudulently-transferred funds who seek to take advantage of equitable exceptions to § 550(a)(l)’s statutory language must establish (1) that they did not have control over the assets received, i.e., that they merely served as a conduit for the assets that were under the actual control of the debtor-trans-feror and (2) that they acted in good faith and as an innocent participant to the fraudulent transfer.\nId.\n. WSFS disputes this, pointing to the Trustee\'s deposition, in which he stated that substantive consolidation was beneficial to the bankruptcy estate because it provided a means of bringing the § 553 claim against WSFS. (WSFS Mem. at 90). In the deposition, the Trustee could cite to no other ground for extending substantive consolidation to include UDI nunc pro tunc to UMI’s petition date of July 23, 2009.\nThe Trustee’s deposition testimony provides little support to WSFS. The testimony merely reflects the state of affairs existing after substantive consolidation already had been applied to the creditors other than WSFS.\n. In Owens Coming, the Third Circuit left open the question whether a creditor may carve itself out of the effects of substantive consolidation. See, 419 F.3d at 210 n. 16, 212 n. 22 (discussing possibility of partial consolidation). Right or wrong, that is what occurred in this case, subject to the parties’ agreement that the Trustee retained the right to expand the partial consolidation to encompass WSFS.\n. The deadline for filing claims has expired. (See Order dated March 10, 2010; Bky. No. 09-15404, Doc. #297).\n. Previously, I entered an interlocutory order, dismissing certain counts of the Trustee\'s Amended Complaint that, similarly were either non-core or core claims as to which the bankruptcy court lacks constitutional authority to enter a final judgment, absent consent of the parties. (See Order dated June 14, 2012; Adv. No. 11-512, Doc. #43). Specifically, that Order dismissed the Trustee’s Count Four (breach of fiduciary duty) and Count Nine (11 U.S.C. § 547 preference) claims. The Trustee did not re-plead those claims in his Second Amended Complaint.\nThe June 14, 2012 order’s dismissal of Counts Four and Nine also was for purposes of trial in the bankruptcy court, not the entry of a final order or judgment of dismissal. Consequently, the comprehensive Report and Recommendation that I will transmit to the bankruptcy court at the conclusion of this adversary proceeding also will recommend that the district court enter an appropriate order with respect to those claims.', 'type': 'majority'}]"

Gottschall, United States District Judge\nPlaintiff LeSaint Logistics, LLC (“Le-Saint”) filed a three count amended complaint against Defendants Electra Bicycle Company, LLC (“Electra”) and Trek Bicycle Corporation (“Trek”) (collectively, “Defendants”). LeSaint’s claims arise out of Defendants’ alleged breach of contract, intentional interference with business relations, and fraud. Elektra and Trek move to dismiss all claims brought against them under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). For the reasons stated below, the court grants the motion in part and denies it in part.\nI. BACKGROUND\nThe following facts taken from the amended complaint are accepted as true for the purposes of ruling on the motion to dismiss now before the court. LeSaint is in the business of warehousing and logistical management services. Dkt. 34, ¶ 1. Electra is in the business of manufacturing and selling consumer products, including bicycles and bicycle accessories. Id., ¶ 2. On or about February 17, 2009, LeSaint and Electra entered into a contract wherein LeSaint was to provide warehouse and logistics services to Electra at LeSaint’s warehouses in exchange for payment of certain sums of money for a period of three years (“Master Agreement”). Le-Saint alleges that Schedule A of the Master Agreement required Elektra to store between 7,000 and 70,000 units in each of LeSaint’s warehouses or facilities. Id., Ex. A.\nOn or about August 8, 2013, LeSaint and Electra agreed to extend the terms of the Master Agreement through June 30, 2016 by executing the Addendum to Contract and Rate Schedule (“Addendum”). In addition to incorporating the terms of the Master Agreement, the Addendum included a provision whereby the parties agreed not to terminate the agreement through December 31, 2014 (“early-termination provision”). Id., ¶ 5. The Addendum also provided that, “[ajfter September 30, 2014, early cancellation is available with a 90-day written notice of early termination.” Dkt. 34-1, p. 26.\nTrek is engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling consumer products. Trek is alleged to have purchased Electra sometime'prior to January 7, 2014. Dkt. 44, p. 2. However, LeSaint alleges that Trek and Electra began purchase negotiations prior to the August 8, 2013 execution of the Addendum between Electra and Le-Saint. At the time Trek is alleged to have purchased Electra, Richard Wells, a representative of Electra, contacted LeSaint account manager Kevin Brown to notify Mr. Brown of the purchase and that, as a result, Electra would be removing its inventory out of the LeSaint facilities. Dkt. 34, ¶ 29.\nLeSaint alleges that, prior • to May 1, 2014, Electra breached the Addendum and Master Agreement (collectively, “Agreement”) by depleting the inventory in the LeSaint facilities to less than 7,000 units. Dkt. 34, ¶ 19. In addition, LeSaint alleges that ■ Electra and/or' Trek breached the Agreement by removing' all of the goods stored in the LeSaint facilities located in Romeoville, Illinois. Finally, LeSaint alleges that, on or about May 31, 2014, Electra and/or Trek further breached the Agreement by removing all goods stored in the LeSaint facilities located in Fontana, California, thereby terminating the Agreement in violation of the no early termination provision set forth in Addendum. Id., ’¶21. Electra’s alleged early termination of ’agreement and Trek’s alleged interference-with the business relations between Electra and LeSaint form the basis of LeSaint’s claims for breach of contract, tortious interference with business relations, and fraudulent inducement.\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nTo survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009), citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). A claim satisfies this pleading standard when its factual allegations “raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56, 127 S.Ct. 1955. For the purposes of a motion to dismiss, the court takes all facts alleged by the plaintiff as true and draws all reasonable inferences from those facts in the plaintiffs favor, although conclusory allegations that merely recite the elements of a claim are not entitled to this presumption of truth. Virnich v. Vorwald, 664 F.3d 206, 212. (7th Cir.2011). Exhibits attached to a motion to dismiss are considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the complaint and are central to the claims. Wright v. Associated Ins. Companies Inc., 29 F.3,d 1244, 1248 (7th Cir. 1994).\nIII. DISCÚSSIQN\nBefore addressing the merits of the motion to dismiss, the court must first turn to a choice of law issue.that-was relatively unaddressed in the parties’ briefs. According to the Master Agreement executed by LeSaint and Electra, any dispute arising out of the agreement “shall be governed by the laws of the state of California without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.” Dkt. 34, Ex. A, p. 10. Although the Master Agreement clearly states that California law.will govern any disputes between the parties, both Electra and Le-Saint rely on Illinois law to support their respective positions. Because the parties rely extensively, if not exclusively, on Illinois law, the issue is waived .and Illinois law will be applied. Vukadinovich v. McCarthy, 59 F.3d 58, 62 (7th Cir.1995) (choice of law is waivable); Viscofan USA Inc. v. Flint Group, No. 08 C 2066, 2009 WL 1285529, at *2-3 (C.D.Ill. May 7, 2009) (McCuskey, J.) (party may waive contractual choice-of-law provision by relying on other law in their argument to the court).\nA. Breach of Contract\nDefendants argue that they are entitled to dismissal of the breach of contract claim for two reasons: (1) the Agreement did not require Electra to pay a minimum amount for, or use a minimum amount of, Le-Saint’s services; and (2) Trek was not a party to the Agreement and therefore cannot be sued for breach of contract. The court will first address whether the Agreement required Electra to use a minimum amount of LeSaint’s services.\nIn construing. a . contract, a court’s primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties. Harmon v. Gordon, 712 F.3d 1044, 1050 (7th Cir.2013), citing Thompson v. Gordon, 241 Ill.2d 428, 349. Ill.Dec. 936, 948 N.E.2d 39, 47 (2007). The contract must be construed as a whole; each provision must be viewed in light of the other provisions of the contract. Harmon, 712 F.3d at 1050. If the contract’s language is unambiguous, it must be given its plain and ordinary meaning. Id. Contract language is not ambiguous simply .because the parties disagree as to its meaning, but only if it is “reasonably susceptible to different constructions.” Kaplan v. Shure Bros., 266 F.3d 598, 605 (7th Cir.2001). If, however, the contract is “susceptible to more than one meaning,” the court may consider extrinsic evidence to determine the parties’ intent. Harmon, 712 F.3d at 1050. Although it is true that once contractual ambiguity is established, the task of interpreting the contract’s meaning generally becomes a question of fact for the jury, interpretation is a question of law for the court so long as the extrinsic evidence bearing on the interpretation is undisputed. Continental Cas. Co. v. Northwestern Nat. Ins. Co., 427 F.3d 1038, 1041 (7th Cir.2005).\nDefendants argue that the Agreement is not á “requirements” contract or an “exclusive dealing” contract. Moré specifically, they dispute LeSaint’s claim that the Agreement required Electra to store between 7,000 and 70,000 units in each of LeSaint’s warehouses. Instead, Electra and Trek contend that the co'ntract between LeSaint and Electra represents Le-Saint’s agreement to provide services to Electra at designated prices and Electra’s agreement to pay those designated prices as they were incurred. Therefore, Electra argues, its decision to remove its inventory from LeSaint’s warehouses was not a breach of contract as it was not required to store any inventory with LeSaint. The question for the- court' thus becomes whether both constructions are reasonable.\nTo support its claim that it .was not required to store a minimum number of bicycles in LeSaint’s facilities, Electra argues that the Master Agreement explains that Schedule A sets out LeSaint’s obligations and not Electra’s obligations. Dkt. 39, p. 6. (“Giving effect to the express provisions of the Contract, Schedule A requires LeSaint to have available sufficient storage space for ‘between approximately 7.000 and .70,000 units in each warehouse.’ ”). Therefore, Electra argues that it was not required to store at. least 7,000 bicycles, but rather that LeSaint had to make space available for approximately 7.000 bicycles. However, in reading the Master Agreement,' there is no language to support Electra’s argument that Schedule A sets out only LeSaint’s obligations. Nor is there any language to support its allegation that Schedule B pertains only to Electra’s obligations. Both schedules simply make more definite the terms of the Master Agreement for both parties.\nThe court finds that an ambiguity exists regarding whether Electra was required to maintain a certain number--of bicycles in LeSaint’s facilities and, if so, exactly how many bicycles, it is entirely reasonable to conclude that ■ LeSaint’s interpretation of Schedule A is correct — that Electra agreed to house approximately 7,000 to 70,000 in each of LeSaint’s warehouses. It may also be reasonable to conclude that the indefinite terms used to. describe the number of bicycled to be stored in LeSaint’s facilities lends credence to Electra’s argument that it- was not required to store' a- minimum number .of bicycles. However, there is not enough extrinsic evidence before the court to support one party’s -understanding of the Master-Agreement, and more specifically. Schedule A, over the other party’s understanding. Because this ambiguity exists, and because there is not enough undisputed extrinsic evidence before the court, interpreting the contract’s meaning is a question of fact. Therefore, at -this stage, LeSaint has sufficiently pled a cause of action for a .breach ..of.contract against Electra. As a result,- Electra’s motion to dismiss the breach of contract claim is denied.\nWe now turn to Trek’s argument that it be dismissed from the bréach of contract claim. The elements for a breach of contract claim are (1) the existence of a valid and enforceable contract; (2) substantial performance by the plaintiff; (3) breach of contract by the defendant; and (4) resultant injury to the plaintiff. Avila v. CitiMortgage, Inc., 801 F.3d 777, 786 (7th Cir.2015). LeSaint cannot maintain its breach of contract claim against Trek because Trek was not' a party to either the Master Agreement or the Addendum. Northbound Group, Inc. v. Norvax, Inc., 795 F.3d 647, 650 (7th Cir.2015), quoting EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U.S. 279, 294, 122 S.Ct. 754, 151 L.Ed.2d 755 (“It goes without saying that a contract cannot bind a nonparty”).\nLeSaint’s argument that Trek, by purchasing Electra, is bound by the terms of the Master Agreement through a section of the Master Agreement entitled “Assignment” fails for two, reasons. First, as noted by Defendants, Electra and Trek remain separate corporate entities such that holding Trek responsible for a contract entered into by Electra would be improper. Northbound Group, Inc., 795 F.3d at 650 (“The core principle of corporate law is that a corporation is a distinct legal entity, separate from its shareholders, directors, officers, and affiliated corporations, so that the obligations of a corporation are not shared by officers, directors, or shareholders”). Second, LeSaint misunderstands the language set forth in the section which it invokes to hold Trek liable for breach of contract. Section 21 of the Master Agreement bars the parties from assigning their interest under the contract to another party unless both parties to the contract consent to the assignment. Dkt. 34-1, p. 10-11. However, “either party may assign [the] Agreement without such consent to...a successor to the assigning party pursuant to a merger or acquisition.” Id., p. 11 (emphasis added). Clearly, Electra has not elected to assign its interest or obligation under the Agreement to Trek. Therefore, the motion to dismiss the breach of contract claim against Trek is granted.\nB. Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations\nIn Count II of its amended complaint, LeSaint alleges that Trek inter-' fered with the contractual relations between LeSaint and Electra by intentionally and unjustifiably inducing Electra to breach the Agreement. Dkt. 34, ¶ 33. The elements of the tort of intentional interference with contractual relations are: (1) the existence of a valid and enforceable contract; (2) defendant’s awareness of the contractual relation; (3) defendant’s intentional and unjustified inducement of breach of the contract; (4) a subsequent breach by a contracting party caused by the defendant’s wrongful conduct; and (5) damages resulting from the breach. Cromeens, Holloman, Sibert, Inc. v. AB Volvo, 349 F.3d 376, 398 (7th Cir.2003).\nTrek, first argues that LeSaint has failed to adequately state a claim for intentional interference with contractual relations because LeSaint has not pled enough facts that could support its claims. The court disagrees. LeSaint has adequately established the existence of the Agreement, has properly alleged that Trek was aware of the Agreement, and has properly alleged that Trek induced the breach by either removing or directing Electra to remove its inventory from LeSaint’s facility. Le-Saint’s allegations that Trek “directed Electra to negotiate for lower rates based on empty promises and fraudulent misrepresentations of increasing volume and three-year commitment” in Count II are found to be inadequately pled pursuant to the heightened pleading requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). However, LeSaint’s allegation that Trek intentionally interfered with the Agreement by inducing Electra to effectively terminate the Agreement early has been properly pled. In addition, LeSaint has also adequately alleged that Electra breached, the Agreement as set forth earlier and has suffered damages as a result of the breach.\nTrek’s next argument for dismissal appears to be that, by removing its inventory from LeSaint’s facilities, Trek and Electra were engaging in a measured and justifiable business judgment, thereby defeating the third element of intentional interference with contractual relations. However, in analyzing whether inducement of breaching a contract is “justified,” the courts look to see if the defendant is privileged to interfere with contracts. Service by Air, Inc. v. Phoenix Cartage and Air Freight, LLC, 78 F.Supp.3d 852, 864 (N.D.Ill.2015).\nUnder Illinois law, corporate officers are privileged to interfere with contracts. Id. citing HPI Health Care Servs., Inc. v. Mt. Vernon Hosp., Inc., 131 Ill.2d 145, 157, 137 Ill.Dec. 19, 545 N.E.2d 672 (Ill.1989). This privilege covers the acts of corporate officers, directors, and shareholders undertaken on behalf of the corporation. See, e.g., Swager v. Court, 77 Ill.2d 173, 32 Ill.Dec. 540, 395 N.E.2d 921, 928 (1979) (recognizing privilege for corporate officers, directors, and shareholders to influence the actions of their corporation); IOS Capital, Inc. v. Phoenix Printing, Inc., 348 Ill.App.3d 366, 283 Ill.Dec. 640, 808 N.E.2d 606, 612 (2004) (“Illinois courts recognize a privilege for corporate officers and directors to use their business judgment and discretion on behalf of the corporation.”); MOD, Inc. v. Dalen Trading Co., 230 Ill.App.3d 916, 172 Ill.Dec. 736, 596 N.E.2d 15, 18 (1992) (same).\nThe conditional privilege protects both individuals and entities. Nation v. American Capital, Ltd., 682 F.3d 648, 652 (7th Cir.2012). The defendant in Nation controlled the majority of the subject company’s board of directors and, in that role, had a conditional privilege to interfere with the company’s contracts. Id. The defendant also had a majority equity interest in the company which gave it the right to lawfully influence the actions of the company in pursuit of the company’s affairs. Id., citing Langer v. Becker, 176 Ill.App.3d 745, 126 Ill.Dec. 203, 531 N.E.2d 830, 833 (1988) (“[T]he stockholders of a corporation have an interest in the corporation and the right to lawfully influence the actions of the directors of the corporation.”).\n“Illinois courts have been unclear about whether the issue of conditional privilege is part of the plaintiffs claim — that is, an aspect of the plaintiffs burden to prove that the defendant’s interference with his contract was unjustified — or an affirmative defense to be proved by the defendant.” Nation, 682 F.3d at 651, n. 2. However, the point is moot at this stage. Although Trek and Electra admit in its memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss that Trek is Electra’s “corporate parent,” it is unknown, at this stage, whether Trek, like the defendant in Nation, controls Electra’s board of directors or owns a majority equity interest which would give it the right to lawfully influence Electra’s actions. Therefore, the motion to dismiss the intentional interference of contractual relations claim against Trek is denied.\nC. Fraudulent Inducement\nIn Count III of the amended complaint, LeSaint alleges that Electra fraudulently induced LeSaint into executing the Addendum, which froze prices at the rate agreed upon in the Master Agreement instead of increasing prices over a new three-year period, when Electra had no intention of ever honoring the Addendum. Under Illinois law, a claim for fraudulent inducement requires proof of the following elements: (1) a false statement of material fact; (2) known or believed to be false by the person making it; (3) an intent to induce the other party to act; (4) action by the other party in reliance on the truth of the statement; and-(5) damage to the other party resulting from such reliance. Hoseman v. Weinschneider, 322 F.3d 468, 476 (7th Cir.2003).\nLeSaint’s, allegations do not adequately state a claim, for fraudulent inducement. Rule 9(b) requires LeSaint to plead with' particularity the circumstances constituting fraud by alleging the “who, what, when, where, and how.” Wigod v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 673 F.3d 547, 569 (7th Cir.2012). LeSaint has failed to meet this heightened pleading standard by failing to plead, with any sort of specificity, a false statement of material fact made by Electra. The only specific statement that Le-Saint alleges Electra made took place on or about July 13, 2013. According to Le-Saint, Richard Wells of Electra proposed a rate freeze for the Addendum in exchange for an increase in the number bicycles moving through LeSaint’s warehouse facilities. Dkt. 34, ¶ 41-42. LeSaint claims that Electra sought to obtain the rate freeze with the knowledge that it would not honor the \""three-year Addendum. However, Le-Saint has not alleged that, at the time the statement was made by Mr. Wells, Mr. Wells knew it was false. LeSaint has also not alleged that, at the time the statement was made, Electra was aware that it was going to be purchased by Trek. Nor does LeSaint allege that, at the time the statement was made, Electra knew it was going to be purchased by Trek and that, as a result, it Would move all of its inventory out of LeSaint’s warehouse facilities.\nAccording to the amended complaint and its attached exhibits, the Addendum was executed on August 8, 2013. Trek is alleged to have acquired Electra sometime prior to January 7, 2014. The amended complaint is devoid of any allegations that could reasonably lead the court to conclude that the July 13, 2013 statement by Richard Wells was anything more than a business negotiation made on behalf of Electra in order to secure the best deal possible. To assume that the statement is fraudulent simply because Trek purchased Electra at a later date and because Electra allegedly breached the contract at a later date is implausible at worst, Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009), and, at best, not well pled. Count III is dismissed.\nIV.

Electra arid Trek do not contest LeSairit’s claim that Trek purchased Electra in their Motion to Dismiss, Memorandum in Support of their Motion to Dismiss or Reply in Support of their Motion to Dismiss.

Gottschall, United States District Judge', 'text': 'MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER\nJoan B. Gottschall, United States District Judge\nPlaintiff LeSaint Logistics, LLC (“Le-Saint”) filed a three count amended complaint against Defendants Electra Bicycle Company, LLC (“Electra”) and Trek Bicycle Corporation (“Trek”) (collectively, “Defendants”). LeSaint’s claims arise out of Defendants’ alleged breach of contract, intentional interference with business relations, and fraud. Elektra and Trek move to dismiss all claims brought against them under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). For the reasons stated below, the court grants the motion in part and denies it in part.\nI. BACKGROUND\nThe following facts taken from the amended complaint are accepted as true for the purposes of ruling on the motion to dismiss now before the court. LeSaint is in the business of warehousing and logistical management services. Dkt. 34, ¶ 1. Electra is in the business of manufacturing and selling consumer products, including bicycles and bicycle accessories. Id., ¶ 2. On or about February 17, 2009, LeSaint and Electra entered into a contract wherein LeSaint was to provide warehouse and logistics services to Electra at LeSaint’s warehouses in exchange for payment of certain sums of money for a period of three years (“Master Agreement”). Le-Saint alleges that Schedule A of the Master Agreement required Elektra to store between 7,000 and 70,000 units in each of LeSaint’s warehouses or facilities. Id., Ex. A.\nOn or about August 8, 2013, LeSaint and Electra agreed to extend the terms of the Master Agreement through June 30, 2016 by executing the Addendum to Contract and Rate Schedule (“Addendum”). In addition to incorporating the terms of the Master Agreement, the Addendum included a provision whereby the parties agreed not to terminate the agreement through December 31, 2014 (“early-termination provision”). Id., ¶ 5. The Addendum also provided that, “[ajfter September 30, 2014, early cancellation is available with a 90-day written notice of early termination.” Dkt. 34-1, p. 26.\nTrek is engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling consumer products. Trek is alleged to have purchased Electra sometime\'prior to January 7, 2014. Dkt. 44, p. 2. However, LeSaint alleges that Trek and Electra began purchase negotiations prior to the August 8, 2013 execution of the Addendum between Electra and Le-Saint. At the time Trek is alleged to have purchased Electra, Richard Wells, a representative of Electra, contacted LeSaint account manager Kevin Brown to notify Mr. Brown of the purchase and that, as a result, Electra would be removing its inventory out of the LeSaint facilities. Dkt. 34, ¶ 29.\nLeSaint alleges that, prior • to May 1, 2014, Electra breached the Addendum and Master Agreement (collectively, “Agreement”) by depleting the inventory in the LeSaint facilities to less than 7,000 units. Dkt. 34, ¶ 19. In addition, LeSaint alleges that ■ Electra and/or\' Trek breached the Agreement by removing\' all of the goods stored in the LeSaint facilities located in Romeoville, Illinois. Finally, LeSaint alleges that, on or about May 31, 2014, Electra and/or Trek further breached the Agreement by removing all goods stored in the LeSaint facilities located in Fontana, California, thereby terminating the Agreement in violation of the no early termination provision set forth in Addendum. Id., ’¶21. Electra’s alleged early termination of ’agreement and Trek’s alleged interference-with the business relations between Electra and LeSaint form the basis of LeSaint’s claims for breach of contract, tortious interference with business relations, and fraudulent inducement.\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nTo survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009), citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). A claim satisfies this pleading standard when its factual allegations “raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56, 127 S.Ct. 1955. For the purposes of a motion to dismiss, the court takes all facts alleged by the plaintiff as true and draws all reasonable inferences from those facts in the plaintiffs favor, although conclusory allegations that merely recite the elements of a claim are not entitled to this presumption of truth. Virnich v. Vorwald, 664 F.3d 206, 212. (7th Cir.2011). Exhibits attached to a motion to dismiss are considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the complaint and are central to the claims. Wright v. Associated Ins. Companies Inc., 29 F.3,d 1244, 1248 (7th Cir. 1994).\nIII. DISCÚSSIQN\nBefore addressing the merits of the motion to dismiss, the court must first turn to a choice of law issue.that-was relatively unaddressed in the parties’ briefs. According to the Master Agreement executed by LeSaint and Electra, any dispute arising out of the agreement “shall be governed by the laws of the state of California without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.” Dkt. 34, Ex. A, p. 10. Although the Master Agreement clearly states that California law.will govern any disputes between the parties, both Electra and Le-Saint rely on Illinois law to support their respective positions. Because the parties rely extensively, if not exclusively, on Illinois law, the issue is waived .and Illinois law will be applied. Vukadinovich v. McCarthy, 59 F.3d 58, 62 (7th Cir.1995) (choice of law is waivable); Viscofan USA Inc. v. Flint Group, No. 08 C 2066, 2009 WL 1285529, at *2-3 (C.D.Ill. May 7, 2009) (McCuskey, J.) (party may waive contractual choice-of-law provision by relying on other law in their argument to the court).\nA. Breach of Contract\nDefendants argue that they are entitled to dismissal of the breach of contract claim for two reasons: (1) the Agreement did not require Electra to pay a minimum amount for, or use a minimum amount of, Le-Saint’s services; and (2) Trek was not a party to the Agreement and therefore cannot be sued for breach of contract. The court will first address whether the Agreement required Electra to use a minimum amount of LeSaint’s services.\nIn construing. a . contract, a court’s primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties. Harmon v. Gordon, 712 F.3d 1044, 1050 (7th Cir.2013), citing Thompson v. Gordon, 241 Ill.2d 428, 349. Ill.Dec. 936, 948 N.E.2d 39, 47 (2007). The contract must be construed as a whole; each provision must be viewed in light of the other provisions of the contract. Harmon, 712 F.3d at 1050. If the contract’s language is unambiguous, it must be given its plain and ordinary meaning. Id. Contract language is not ambiguous simply .because the parties disagree as to its meaning, but only if it is “reasonably susceptible to different constructions.” Kaplan v. Shure Bros., 266 F.3d 598, 605 (7th Cir.2001). If, however, the contract is “susceptible to more than one meaning,” the court may consider extrinsic evidence to determine the parties’ intent. Harmon, 712 F.3d at 1050. Although it is true that once contractual ambiguity is established, the task of interpreting the contract’s meaning generally becomes a question of fact for the jury, interpretation is a question of law for the court so long as the extrinsic evidence bearing on the interpretation is undisputed. Continental Cas. Co. v. Northwestern Nat. Ins. Co., 427 F.3d 1038, 1041 (7th Cir.2005).\nDefendants argue that the Agreement is not á “requirements” contract or an “exclusive dealing” contract. Moré specifically, they dispute LeSaint’s claim that the Agreement required Electra to store between 7,000 and 70,000 units in each of LeSaint’s warehouses. Instead, Electra and Trek contend that the co\'ntract between LeSaint and Electra represents Le-Saint’s agreement to provide services to Electra at designated prices and Electra’s agreement to pay those designated prices as they were incurred. Therefore, Electra argues, its decision to remove its inventory from LeSaint’s warehouses was not a breach of contract as it was not required to store any inventory with LeSaint. The question for the- court\' thus becomes whether both constructions are reasonable.\nTo support its claim that it .was not required to store a minimum number of bicycles in LeSaint’s facilities, Electra argues that the Master Agreement explains that Schedule A sets out LeSaint’s obligations and not Electra’s obligations. Dkt. 39, p. 6. (“Giving effect to the express provisions of the Contract, Schedule A requires LeSaint to have available sufficient storage space for ‘between approximately 7.000 and .70,000 units in each warehouse.’ ”). Therefore, Electra argues that it was not required to store at. least 7,000 bicycles, but rather that LeSaint had to make space available for approximately 7.000 bicycles. However, in reading the Master Agreement,\' there is no language to support Electra’s argument that Schedule A sets out only LeSaint’s obligations. Nor is there any language to support its allegation that Schedule B pertains only to Electra’s obligations. Both schedules simply make more definite the terms of the Master Agreement for both parties.\nThe court finds that an ambiguity exists regarding whether Electra was required to maintain a certain number--of bicycles in LeSaint’s facilities and, if so, exactly how many bicycles, it is entirely reasonable to conclude that ■ LeSaint’s interpretation of Schedule A is correct — that Electra agreed to house approximately 7,000 to 70,000 in each of LeSaint’s warehouses. It may also be reasonable to conclude that the indefinite terms used to. describe the number of bicycled to be stored in LeSaint’s facilities lends credence to Electra’s argument that it- was not required to store\' a- minimum number .of bicycles. However, there is not enough extrinsic evidence before the court to support one party’s -understanding of the Master-Agreement, and more specifically. Schedule A, over the other party’s understanding. Because this ambiguity exists, and because there is not enough undisputed extrinsic evidence before the court, interpreting the contract’s meaning is a question of fact. Therefore, at -this stage, LeSaint has sufficiently pled a cause of action for a .breach ..of.contract against Electra. As a result,- Electra’s motion to dismiss the breach of contract claim is denied.\nWe now turn to Trek’s argument that it be dismissed from the bréach of contract claim. The elements for a breach of contract claim are (1) the existence of a valid and enforceable contract; (2) substantial performance by the plaintiff; (3) breach of contract by the defendant; and (4) resultant injury to the plaintiff. Avila v. CitiMortgage, Inc., 801 F.3d 777, 786 (7th Cir.2015). LeSaint cannot maintain its breach of contract claim against Trek because Trek was not\' a party to either the Master Agreement or the Addendum. Northbound Group, Inc. v. Norvax, Inc., 795 F.3d 647, 650 (7th Cir.2015), quoting EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U.S. 279, 294, 122 S.Ct. 754, 151 L.Ed.2d 755 (“It goes without saying that a contract cannot bind a nonparty”).\nLeSaint’s argument that Trek, by purchasing Electra, is bound by the terms of the Master Agreement through a section of the Master Agreement entitled “Assignment” fails for two, reasons. First, as noted by Defendants, Electra and Trek remain separate corporate entities such that holding Trek responsible for a contract entered into by Electra would be improper. Northbound Group, Inc., 795 F.3d at 650 (“The core principle of corporate law is that a corporation is a distinct legal entity, separate from its shareholders, directors, officers, and affiliated corporations, so that the obligations of a corporation are not shared by officers, directors, or shareholders”). Second, LeSaint misunderstands the language set forth in the section which it invokes to hold Trek liable for breach of contract. Section 21 of the Master Agreement bars the parties from assigning their interest under the contract to another party unless both parties to the contract consent to the assignment. Dkt. 34-1, p. 10-11. However, “either party may assign [the] Agreement without such consent to...a successor to the assigning party pursuant to a merger or acquisition.” Id., p. 11 (emphasis added). Clearly, Electra has not elected to assign its interest or obligation under the Agreement to Trek. Therefore, the motion to dismiss the breach of contract claim against Trek is granted.\nB. Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations\nIn Count II of its amended complaint, LeSaint alleges that Trek inter-\' fered with the contractual relations between LeSaint and Electra by intentionally and unjustifiably inducing Electra to breach the Agreement. Dkt. 34, ¶ 33. The elements of the tort of intentional interference with contractual relations are: (1) the existence of a valid and enforceable contract; (2) defendant’s awareness of the contractual relation; (3) defendant’s intentional and unjustified inducement of breach of the contract; (4) a subsequent breach by a contracting party caused by the defendant’s wrongful conduct; and (5) damages resulting from the breach. Cromeens, Holloman, Sibert, Inc. v. AB Volvo, 349 F.3d 376, 398 (7th Cir.2003).\nTrek, first argues that LeSaint has failed to adequately state a claim for intentional interference with contractual relations because LeSaint has not pled enough facts that could support its claims. The court disagrees. LeSaint has adequately established the existence of the Agreement, has properly alleged that Trek was aware of the Agreement, and has properly alleged that Trek induced the breach by either removing or directing Electra to remove its inventory from LeSaint’s facility. Le-Saint’s allegations that Trek “directed Electra to negotiate for lower rates based on empty promises and fraudulent misrepresentations of increasing volume and three-year commitment” in Count II are found to be inadequately pled pursuant to the heightened pleading requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). However, LeSaint’s allegation that Trek intentionally interfered with the Agreement by inducing Electra to effectively terminate the Agreement early has been properly pled. In addition, LeSaint has also adequately alleged that Electra breached, the Agreement as set forth earlier and has suffered damages as a result of the breach.\nTrek’s next argument for dismissal appears to be that, by removing its inventory from LeSaint’s facilities, Trek and Electra were engaging in a measured and justifiable business judgment, thereby defeating the third element of intentional interference with contractual relations. However, in analyzing whether inducement of breaching a contract is “justified,” the courts look to see if the defendant is privileged to interfere with contracts. Service by Air, Inc. v. Phoenix Cartage and Air Freight, LLC, 78 F.Supp.3d 852, 864 (N.D.Ill.2015).\nUnder Illinois law, corporate officers are privileged to interfere with contracts. Id. citing HPI Health Care Servs., Inc. v. Mt. Vernon Hosp., Inc., 131 Ill.2d 145, 157, 137 Ill.Dec. 19, 545 N.E.2d 672 (Ill.1989). This privilege covers the acts of corporate officers, directors, and shareholders undertaken on behalf of the corporation. See, e.g., Swager v. Court, 77 Ill.2d 173, 32 Ill.Dec. 540, 395 N.E.2d 921, 928 (1979) (recognizing privilege for corporate officers, directors, and shareholders to influence the actions of their corporation); IOS Capital, Inc. v. Phoenix Printing, Inc., 348 Ill.App.3d 366, 283 Ill.Dec. 640, 808 N.E.2d 606, 612 (2004) (“Illinois courts recognize a privilege for corporate officers and directors to use their business judgment and discretion on behalf of the corporation.”); MOD, Inc. v. Dalen Trading Co., 230 Ill.App.3d 916, 172 Ill.Dec. 736, 596 N.E.2d 15, 18 (1992) (same).\nThe conditional privilege protects both individuals and entities. Nation v. American Capital, Ltd., 682 F.3d 648, 652 (7th Cir.2012). The defendant in Nation controlled the majority of the subject company’s board of directors and, in that role, had a conditional privilege to interfere with the company’s contracts. Id. The defendant also had a majority equity interest in the company which gave it the right to lawfully influence the actions of the company in pursuit of the company’s affairs. Id., citing Langer v. Becker, 176 Ill.App.3d 745, 126 Ill.Dec. 203, 531 N.E.2d 830, 833 (1988) (“[T]he stockholders of a corporation have an interest in the corporation and the right to lawfully influence the actions of the directors of the corporation.”).\n“Illinois courts have been unclear about whether the issue of conditional privilege is part of the plaintiffs claim — that is, an aspect of the plaintiffs burden to prove that the defendant’s interference with his contract was unjustified — or an affirmative defense to be proved by the defendant.” Nation, 682 F.3d at 651, n. 2. However, the point is moot at this stage. Although Trek and Electra admit in its memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss that Trek is Electra’s “corporate parent,” it is unknown, at this stage, whether Trek, like the defendant in Nation, controls Electra’s board of directors or owns a majority equity interest which would give it the right to lawfully influence Electra’s actions. Therefore, the motion to dismiss the intentional interference of contractual relations claim against Trek is denied.\nC. Fraudulent Inducement\nIn Count III of the amended complaint, LeSaint alleges that Electra fraudulently induced LeSaint into executing the Addendum, which froze prices at the rate agreed upon in the Master Agreement instead of increasing prices over a new three-year period, when Electra had no intention of ever honoring the Addendum. Under Illinois law, a claim for fraudulent inducement requires proof of the following elements: (1) a false statement of material fact; (2) known or believed to be false by the person making it; (3) an intent to induce the other party to act; (4) action by the other party in reliance on the truth of the statement; and-(5) damage to the other party resulting from such reliance. Hoseman v. Weinschneider, 322 F.3d 468, 476 (7th Cir.2003).\nLeSaint’s, allegations do not adequately state a claim, for fraudulent inducement. Rule 9(b) requires LeSaint to plead with\' particularity the circumstances constituting fraud by alleging the “who, what, when, where, and how.” Wigod v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 673 F.3d 547, 569 (7th Cir.2012). LeSaint has failed to meet this heightened pleading standard by failing to plead, with any sort of specificity, a false statement of material fact made by Electra. The only specific statement that Le-Saint alleges Electra made took place on or about July 13, 2013. According to Le-Saint, Richard Wells of Electra proposed a rate freeze for the Addendum in exchange for an increase in the number bicycles moving through LeSaint’s warehouse facilities. Dkt. 34, ¶ 41-42. LeSaint claims that Electra sought to obtain the rate freeze with the knowledge that it would not honor the ""three-year Addendum. However, Le-Saint has not alleged that, at the time the statement was made by Mr. Wells, Mr. Wells knew it was false. LeSaint has also not alleged that, at the time the statement was made, Electra was aware that it was going to be purchased by Trek. Nor does LeSaint allege that, at the time the statement was made, Electra knew it was going to be purchased by Trek and that, as a result, it Would move all of its inventory out of LeSaint’s warehouse facilities.\nAccording to the amended complaint and its attached exhibits, the Addendum was executed on August 8, 2013. Trek is alleged to have acquired Electra sometime prior to January 7, 2014. The amended complaint is devoid of any allegations that could reasonably lead the court to conclude that the July 13, 2013 statement by Richard Wells was anything more than a business negotiation made on behalf of Electra in order to secure the best deal possible. To assume that the statement is fraudulent simply because Trek purchased Electra at a later date and because Electra allegedly breached the contract at a later date is implausible at worst, Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009), and, at best, not well pled. Count III is dismissed.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, Defendants’ motion to dismiss [38] is granted in part and denied in part.\n. Electra arid Trek do not contest LeSairit’s claim that Trek purchased Electra in their Motion to Dismiss, Memorandum in Support of their Motion to Dismiss or Reply in Support of their Motion to Dismiss. However, Defendants allege that Trek and Electra remain separate corporate entities. Dkt. 39, p. 9,\n.

The parties now dispute the éffectiveness of a retroactive sublicense that the licensee recently granted to one of its affiliates; Finding that the issuance of a retroactivé sublicense does not violate the terms of the licensing agreement, this Opinion grants the licensee’s motion for summary judgment.\nThe patent holders are defendants Tes-serson Ltd. (“Tesseron”), Industrial Print Technologies L.L.C. (“IPT”), and Forrest P. Gauthier (“Gauthier”; collectively, “defendants”). They seek a declaratory judgment that the plaintiffs’ purported subli-cense is invalid as well as damages for the plaintiffs’ sale-in this country of high speed industrial-sized printing presses manufactured by the Netherlands-based company Océ N.V., which the defendants assert contain components that infringe the defendants’ patents (the “Patents”). •\nThe defendants’ licensee is plaintiff Canon Inc. (“CINC”). CINC asserts that, as permitted by its 2006 license agreement with Tesseron (“Agreement”), it issued an oral sublicense to its subsidiary Canon U.S.A. (“CUSA”) in 2006. Since the existence of that oral sublicense is a hotly disputed question of fact, CINC recently executed a. written' sublicense to CUSA (“2015 Sublicense”). This motion practice addresses, inter alia, the retroactive effect of that 2015 Sublicense.\nIf the 2015 Sublicense has retroactive effect, the plaintiffs contend that the Subli-cense covers the purchase and resale by CUSA of Océ printing presses from 2013 to the present. CUSA importéd the Océ presses and resold them to its affiliate Canon Solutions America, Inc. (“CSA”). Although a CINC affiliate, and as further explained below, CSA is n.ot an eligible sublicensee pursuant to the Agreement.\nAccordingly, CINC asserts that the sales of Océ products in the United States that have been made since 2013 — products purchased and imported by CUSA from Océ — are authorized by its Agreement with the defendants and that no additional licensing fees must be paid. The defendants disagree. The critical facts that serve as background to this dispute follow.\nBACKGROUND\nThe following, facts are undisputed, unless otherwise noted. In January 2006, Tesseron and CINC executed the patent licensing Agreement. , The Agreement grants CINC a “fully paid-up, nonexclusive, license ... to ... sell ... import ... and/or otherwise dispose of’ products re-latéd to and derived from the Patents. The license explicitly covers the sales of infringing products to CINC, including claims of infringement against CINC’s suppliers arising from the sales to CINC and its authorized affiliates. Section 2.03 states that Tesseron\nagrees not to assert any of its rights under the Licensed Patents against any direct or indirect suppliers of [CINC] and its Affiliates including, without limitation, Electronics for Imaging Inc. for infringement or alleged infringement ... of any Licensed Patents only to the extent of the Licensed Products which have been purchased by [CINC]' or such Affiliates during the term\nof the Agreement. The Agreement also includes broad releases for CINC, its Affiliates, and their “direct or indirect suppliers,” extinguishing past liability for “infringement or alleged infringement ... to the extent of the Licensed Products which have been purchased by [CINC] or such Affiliates at any time prior to the Effective Date.” The Agreement identifies the Effective Date as December 31, 2005.\nThe Agreement allows CINC to extend the license to any of its current affiliates and to any future affiliates so long as the future affiliate is not a “major competitor” of Tesseron as of the effective date of the Agreement. The affiliates may not, however, extend additional sublicenses. Specifically, Section 2.02 grants CINC the right, “subject to compliance with the terms and conditions” of the Agreement, “to grant to any ... Affiliates sublicenses under the licenses granted to it under this Agreement but without any right to sublicense further.”\n.The Agreement is retroactive, stating that it is effective as of December 31, 2005, and that it extinguishes liability for any claims regarding past infringement. It is governed by the laws of the State of New York. Read as a whole, the Agreement represents a broad grant of rights to CINC and its Affiliates, including releases from liability for their suppliers. The term of the Agreement extends through the life of the Patents.\nCINC wholly owns CUSA; CUSA was at all relevant times an “Affiliate” of CINC as that term is defined in the Agreement. Plaintiffs previously offered evidence that CINC orally issued a sublicense to CUSA during a meeting between representatives of CINC and CUSA in Tokyo on January 31, 2006. That sublicense was purportedly retroactive to December 31, 2005. Plaintiffs acknowledge that no documents or other contemporaneous corroborating evidence of this oral agreement have been located. The existence of the oral subli-cense presents a disputed issue of fact that may only be resolved at trial. See Canon Inc. v. Tesseron Ltd., No. 14cv5462 (DLC), 2015 WL 4508334 (S.D.N.Y. July 24, 2015) [“Summary Judgment Opinion”].\nAs. of December, 31, 2005, which is the effective date of the Agreement, Océ wholly owned two subsidiaries: Océ North America Inc. (“Océ NA”), which sold Océ printers in the United States, and Océ-Printing Systems GmbH and Co. (“Océ GmbH”), which designed and manufactured Océ printers. All three Océ entities were major competitors of Tesseron as of the Agreement’s effective date. Accordingly, in the event one or more of them ever became an affiliate of CINC, the Océ entities would be ineligible to receive subli-censes under the Agreement.\nIn March 2010, CINC acquired a majority ownership in Océ, and on January 1, 2013, CINC merged its subsidiary Canon Business -Solutions, Inc. with Océ NA, forming CSA. Canon has since acquired 100% control or ownership of Océ and Océ GmbH. Since CSA was created on January 1, 2013, CSA has sold Océ printers to consumers, but has not purchased the printers directly from Océ GmbH. Instead, CSA orders Océ printers from CUSA, which purchases the printers from Océ GmbH.\nIn January 2014, IPT, the current owner of right and title in the Patents, sued both CUSA and CSA in the United States District Court for- the Eastern District of Texas for patent infringement due to the sale of Océ printers through CSA. On January 27, 2015, the Texas action was transferred to this Court as related to the instant case. Industrial Print Technologies, L.L.C. v. Canon U.S.A., Inc. and Canon Solutions America, Inc., No. 15cv672 (DLC).\nPlaintiffs filed the instant action in this Court on July 21, 2014. Their complaint asserts six claims; among others, it asserts claims of breach of contract for improper termination of the Agreement; a declaratory judgment that CUSA holds a valid sub-license under the Agreement; and a declaratory judgment that IPT’s patent fights are exhausted with respect to CUSA sales to CSA. Defendants have brought three counterclaims: a declaratory judgment that any purported sublicense to CUSA is invalid; a declaratory judgment that their termination- of the Agreement- was proper; and a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\nFollowing the Summary Judgment Opinion’s conclusion that .the existence of the 2006 oral sublicense between CINC and CUSA presents a disputed issue of fact, CINC and CUSA entered into a written sublicensing agreement with an effective date of December 31, 2005. CINC signed the 2015 Sublicense on September 14 and CUSA signed it on September 16, 2015. Section 2.02 of the 2015 Sublicense purports -.to “grant[ ] to CUSA, effective retroactively to December 31, 2005,” a subli-cense with all rights attaching thereto.\nOn September 23, 2015, the plaintiffs renewed their motion for partial summary judgment to obtain declarations that the 2015 Sublicense is a valid sublicense under the Agreement and that, as a consequence, defendants’ patent rights in the products CUSA sells to CSA are exhausted. Plaintiffs also seek summary judgment on defendants’ claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The motion was fully submitted on October 16.\nOn October 23, defendants sought leave by letter motion to file a surreply. In that surreply, they argue that the meaning of the term “supplier” in'the Agreement is ambiguous. That argument is addressed below.\nDISCUSSION\nThe standard'that governs a summary judgment motion . is well settled. The Court’s previous description of that standard is incorporated by reference. Summary Judgment Opinion, 2015 WL 4508334, at *3-4;\nThe parties contest whether plaintiffs have the right to renew their motion for summary judgment based on the plaintiffs’ recent execution of the 2015 Subli-cense. “[District courts enjoy considerable discretion in entertaining successive dis-positive motions,” Sira v. Morton, 380 F.3d 57, 68 (2d Cir.2004), “particularly when the moving party has expanded the factual record on which summary judgment is sought.” Brown v. City of Syracuse, 673 F.3d 141, 147 n. 2 (2d Cir.2012) (citation omitted). This renewed motion is brought within the time scheduled for summary judgment motion practice and will be addressed as a timely motion.\nI. Validity of Retroactive Sublicense\nPlaintiffs first move for summary judgment and a declaration that the 2015 Subli-cense is valid. It has previously been determined that, CINC is not required to obtain permission from Tesseron before issuing any sublicense. Summary Judgment Opinion, 2015 WL 4508334, at *5. Moreover, the Agreement does not bar a retroactive sublicense. After all, the Agreement itself is retroactive and contemplated that CINC could immediately extend subli-censes to all of its current Affiliates, presumably also for retroactive terms, and could extend sublicenses as well to a category of future Affiliates. The defendants contend, however, that federal patent law bars retroactive licenses. It does not, at least in the circumstances that pertain here. To support their argument the defendants rely on caselaw that pertains to eo-owned patents and othér intellectual property; that caselaw is inapposite.\nThe basic principles of patent licensing are well established. They begin with the rights that accrue to ownership'of a patent. “A patent grant bestows the legal right to exclude others from making, using, selling, or offering to sell the patented invention in the United States, or importing the invention.” Morrow v. Microsoft Corp., 499 F.3d 1332, 1339 (Fed.Cir.2007) (citing 35 U.S.C. § 154; 35 U.S.C. § 271). “[The] right to exclude is the legal interest[,] created by statute” and belonging originally to the patentee (or patentees). Id. These interests and rights in the patent carry with them the. right to sue patent infringers. 35 U.S.C. § 281. “A patent is, in effect, a bundle of rights which may be divided and assigned, or retained in whole or part,” Alfred E. Mann Found. For Scientific Research v. Cochlear Corp., 604 F.3d 1354, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2010) (citation omitted), and the right to sue is “one of the most valuable ’sticks’ of the bundle.” Davis v. Blige, 505 F.3d 90, 103 (2d Cir.2007) (citation omitted) (copyright).\nAs with any other property, the full panoply of legal rights and interests attached to a patent may be conveyed to another by transfer or assignment. A limited conveyance of rights may also be accomplished through a license, which may be either an exclusive or nonexclusive license. “[A]lthough all the various rights available under [a] patent are initially held by the named inventor or inventors, they may, as a result of licensing' agreements and assignments, become separated and be held by multiple individuals.” Alfred E. Mann Found., 604 F.3d at 1360.\nAn exclusive license “carries with it the right to prevent others from practicing the invention.” Morrow, 499 F.3d at 1340. The holder of an exclusive license “comes so close to having truly proprietary interests -in the patent,” Ortho Pharm. Corp. v. Genetics Inst., Inc., 52 F.3d 1026, 1032 (Fed.Cir.1995) (citation omitted), that she is entitled to enforce the patent’s monopoly through the courts—but only “through or in the name of the owner of th'e patent,” who ordinarily must be joined in any action. Morrow, 499 F.3d at 1340 (citation omitted).\nBy contrast, a nonexclusive license, in its barest form, is just “a covenant by the patent owner not to.sue the licensee for making, using, or selling the patented invention and under which the patent owner reserves the right to grant similar licenses to other entities.” TransCore, LP v. Elec. Transaction Consultants Corp., 563 F.3d 1271, 1276 (Fed.Cir.2009) (citation omitted). Nonexclusive licenses may include provisions granting other rights in the patent, including a right to sublicense. Cf. Intel Corp. v. U.S. Int’l Trade Comm’n, 946 F.2d 821, 826 n. 9 (Fed.Cir.1991).\nThe freedom to license a patent or to sue for infringement of a patent is more restricted, however, when a patent is held by co-owners. Although each co-owiier “is ordinarily , free” to sell a patented invention without regard to the wishes of any other co-owner and to license others to: do so, the right to license others is limited to the right to grant a prospective license. See, e.g., Schering Corp. v. Roussel-UCLAF SA, 104 F.3d 341, 344-45 (Fed.Cir.1997) (citing. 35 U.S.C. § 262). Similarly, a co-owner, may not sue for infringement without joining all other co-owners. STC.UNM v. Intel Corp., 754 F.3d 940, 944 (Fed.Cir.2014), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1700, 191 L.Ed.2d 676 (2015). This limitation of rights is subject to alteration by contract. Patent co-owners may grant each other “the right to«bring suit for infringement of the patent without the other co-owner’s voluntarily joining-the suit.” Schering, 104 F.3d at 344.\nThe restriction on a co-owner’s right to grant a retroactive license arises from two concerns. First, retroactive licensing would undermine the unconsenting co-owner’s right to sue:\nUnlike a settlement, which recognizes'an unauthorized use but waives a settling owner’s accrued claims, of liability, a retroactive license or assignment would — if given legal effect — erase the unauthorized use' from history with the result that the nonparty co-owner’s right to sue for infringement, which accrues when the infringement first occurs; -is extinguished.-\nDavis, 505 F.3d at 103. Thus, “[a] rule permitting retroactive licenses or assignments” could extinguish “one of the most valuable ’sticks’ of the ’bundle of rights.’” Id. (citation omitted).\nSecondly, the inability of a co-owner to unilaterally grant a retroactive license promotes predictability and certainty and discourages infringement. As explained by Davis, if a co-owner could unilaterally grant a retroactive license whenever it wished,- “one could never reliably and definitively determine if and when infringement occurred, because an infringement could be ’undone’ by” one co-owner’s grant of a retroactive license;- for another, •\none could never know who the pool of authorized users or licensors ... would be at -any given time, because a retroac-five transfer could always turn an in-fringer- into a potential user or licensor, who would then have the ability to grant his own retroactive licenses or retrans-fer his new (retroactive) interest retroactively.\nDavis, 505 F.3d at 105. Were retroactive licensing permitted, the court explains,\n[a]n infringer could “buy” his way out of an infringement suit, in which an injured owner may seek enhanced statutory damages and costs... by paying a single co-owner for a license or assigned copyright interest, A retroactive license or assignment that can be obtained from a co-owner not bringing suit, or one willing to settle for a lower price than the co-owner bringing the action, is likely to cost, much less than the value of the copyright interest including the cost of litigation. The result is that infringement is encouraged and rewarded. .\nId. at 106.\nDefendants cite .language in Ethicon, Inc. v. U.S. Surgical Corp., 135 F.3d 1456 (Fed.Cir.1998), as well as Davis to assert that all retroactive patent licenses are forbidden, Yet these cases do not support that proposition.\nThe patent owners in Ethicon were co-owners, 135 F,3d at 1466. Moreover, the portion of Ethicon with the relevant discussion relies wholly upon an earlier case whose reasoning was explicitly addressed to co-ownership; moreover, Ethicon was careful to acknowledge that certain “retroactive licenses of patent rights have been enforced” for patents with “sole owners.” Id. at 1467 n.8.\nAs far as the Davis case is concerned, neither the legal principles nor public policy undergirding the opinion recommend a reading that would indiscriminately ban all copyright- or patent-holders, even solé owners, from voluntarily entering into retroactive license agreements. 'As the Honorable Robert W. Sweet has explained, “the holding in Davis was a narrow one that does not apply to” unless licensing rights are held by co-owners. Spinelli v. Nat'l Football League, 96 F.Supp.3d 81, 124 (S.D.N.Y.2015). The other cases defendants cite — including a District Court case from this District interpreting Davis — are inapposite. For example, in Waterloo Furniture Components, Ltd. v. Haworth, Inc., 467 F.3d 641 (7th Cir.2006), the court determined that a settlement agreement to resolve a claim for past infringement that was entered after the expiration of a patent was not a license. Id. at 647-48. See also N.J. Media Grp. Inc. v. Pirro, No. 13cv7153 (ER), 2015 WL 1086566, at *4 n. 6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2015).\nAccordingly, the discussions in Ethicon and Davis are properly understood as discussions of the scope of licensing rights in the context of co-ownership, not sole ownership, and not as indications of intent to restrict a sophisticated patent holder’s right to negotiate and issue a broad license agreement granting both retrospective and prospective rights. Indeed, any other-reading would represent a- significant restriction on a patent holder’s ability to freely determine by contract any and all exceptions to the right to exclude others from use of her patent.\nMoreover, the arguments against retroactive patent licensing have real force only in the context of co-ownership. Determining -when and if infringement has occurred is not difficult for a sole owner because the sole- owner has the exclusive right to license; past infringement cannot be “undone” by someone with an equal, unrestricted right to license. And the problem of knowing all' authorized, users or li-censors “at any given time” need not arise when sole owners voluntarily grant retroactive licenses. The out-of-control spread of retroactive sublicenses, and hence uncertainty about the number of authorized users, can be controlled by a sole owner, who may impose contractual limitations on the right of a licensee to grant a sublicense or a sublicense with retroactive effect. In sum, the logic of prohibiting the right to issue retroactive licenses does not apply unless there is a co-owner.\n‘ Accordingly, whether a license or sublicense may have retroactive effect depends upon whether the licensor has conferred that right. This is a question of contract interpretation.\nConstruction of a patent “licensing agreement is solely a matter of state law.” Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U.S. 653, 661-62, 89 S.Ct. 1902, 23 L.Ed.2d 610 (1969). The Agreement’s choice of law clause selected New York’s as its governing law. Under New York law, “agreements are to be construed in accordance with the parties’ intent,” “the, best evidence” of which “is what they say in their writing.” In re World Trade Ctr. Disaster Site Litig., 754 F.3d 114, 122 (2d Cir.2014) (citation omitted). “Accordingly, a written agreement that is complete, clear and unambiguous on its face must be enforced according to the plain meaning of its terms.” Id. (citation omitted). Thus, “[a]t the outset, the court must determine whether the language the parties have chosen is ambiguous .... ” Gary Friedrich Enterprises, LLC v. Marvel Characters, Inc., 716 F.3d 302, 313 (2d Cir.2013). “[A]n omission ... in a contract does not constitute an ambiguity.” Jade Realty LLC v. Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2005-EMG, 83 A.D.3d 567, 922 N.Y.S.2d 37, 39 (1st Dep’t 2011) (citation omitted), aff'd, 20 N.Y.3d 881, 957 N.Y.S.2d 280, 980 N.E.2d 945 (2012).\nHere, Tesseron executed a retroactive license with CINC. The Agreement, which was executed on dates in mid-January 2006, acknowledges that it applies retroactively to December 31, 2005, and relieves CINC of all liability for importing, using and selling the licensed products both before December 31, 2005 and until the expiration of the Patents. Read as a whole, the Agreement also permits CINC to grant retroactive sublicenses.\nSection 2.02 of the Agreement governs sublicensing. It limits CINC’s right to sublicense in two specific ways: CINC may sublicense only to Affiliates, as that term is defined in the Agreement, and may not grant those Affiliates the right to sublicense further. It does not restrict the right to sublicense to a grant of prospective licenses. “[I]f parties to a contract omit terms ... the inescapable conclusion is that the parties intended the omission.” Quadrant Structured Products Co. v. Vertin, 23 N.Y.3d 549, 560, 992 N.Y.S.2d 687 (2014). The presence of two sublicensing restrictions and the absence of a provision prohibiting retroactive sublicensing demonstrates that these sophisticated parties chose not to include one. See id. (“[W]here [a] sophisticated drafter omits a term, ex-pressio unius precludes the court from implying it from the general language of the agreement.”).\nFurthermore, the ability to sublicense retroactively is woven into the fabric of the Agreement. The Agreement extinguishes any liability for past infringement on the part of both CINC and its Affiliates. Section 3.01 of the Agreement extinguishes liability for any claims against CINC “and all of the Affiliates [that] have been made, might have been made or might be made at any time prior to the Effective Date.” Indeed, since CINC may issue a sublicense to Affiliates it acquires at any time during the term of the Agreement (as long as later-acquired Affiliates were not major competitors of Tesseron as of the Agreement’s effective date), and the Agreement grants such an Affiliate the full measure of rights under Section 2.01, the Agreement necessarily authorizes retroactive subli-censes.\nThe defendants offer three arguments to support their assertion that the Agreement does not permit a retroactive license and that the 2015 Sublicense is invalid. First, they contend that the parties’ choice of an effective date that was some weeks prior to the execution of the Agreement was simply “an administrative detail” and should not be used as evidence that they extended a retroactive license. But, as described above, the Agreement grants retroactive licenses that cover more than just those few weeks between the effective date and the execution dates. The one-time fee licensed a broad swath of historic and prospective activity for both CINC and its Affiliates.\nDefendants also argue that the 2015 Sublicense is invalid because it represents an improper attempt to settle a dispute of material fact. The 2015 Sublicense includes several provisions purporting to “remove all doubts as to CINC’s grant to CUSA of a full sublicense” in January 2006. Defendants are correct that the 2015 Sublicense cannot resolve the factual dispute over the creation of the 2006 oral sublicense. That factual dispute, however, is mooted by the 2015 Sublicense. The 2015 Sublicense explicitly “grants to CUSA, effective retroactively to December 31, 2005, a fully paid-up non-exclusive sublicense.” That grant does not depend in any way upon whether the 2006 oral sublicense exists.\nFinally, the defendants contend that the 2015 Sublicense, even if valid, cannot encompass the Océ printing presses since the Agreement only licenses component parts and not a complete system. Specifically, defendants point to § 2.03, in which Tes-seron waived its right to assert patent infringement claims against any “supplier of Canon and its Affiliates.” They assert that the term supplier is ambiguous, and that it could refer solely to suppliers of component parts and as opposed to Océ, which supplied CUSA with complete printing presses. Read in the context of the entire Agreement, however, “supplier” is unambiguous and refers to a much broader range of suppliers.\nSection 2.03 states that Tesseron “agrees not to assert any of its rights under the [Patents] against any direct or indirect suppliers of [CINC] and its Affiliates including, without limitation, [EFI] for infringement or alleged infringement ... to the extent of the Licensed Products which have been purchased by [CINC] or such Affiliates” during the term of the Agreement. (Emphasis added.) Thus, “suppliers” refers to suppliers from whom CINC or its Affiliates purchase “Licensed Products.” The definition of “Licensed Products” explicitly includes “any products [or], systems” — precisely what defendants claim the term “suppliers” cannot refer to — as well as “components.” Indeed, the Agreement explains that ,Tesseron’s own patented device is a “system.” Accordingly, because § 2.03 unambiguously provides that. Tesseron will not assert its rights against any suppliers that sell to CINC and its Affiliates systems that rely upon the Patents, the 2015 Sublicense covers the Océ printing presses that CUSA sold to CSA. .\nII. Patent Exhaustion\nPlaintiffs also seek summary judgment on their claim for a declaration that the Patents are' exhausted with respect to the sales by CSA of the licensed products they purchase from CUSA. The parties agree on the underlying legal principle that must be applied.\n“Patent exhaustion is a judicially fashioned doctrine,” JVC Kenwood Corp. v. Nero, Inc., 797 F.3d 1039, 1047 (Fed.Cir.2015) (citation omitted). “The longstanding doctrine of patent exhaustion provides that the initial authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item.” Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., 553 U.S. 617, 625, 128 S.Ct. 2109, 170 L.Ed.2d 996 (2008). “[B]y exhausting the patentee’s monopoly in that item, the sale confers on the purchaser, or any subsequent owner, the right to use or sell the thing as he sees fit.” Bowman v. Monsanto Co., — U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1761, 1766, 185 L.Ed.2d 931, 941 (2013) (citation omitted).\nPlaintiffs have offered evidence — including purchase orders between Océ GmbH and' CUSA and between CUSA and CSA, a customs invoicé from Océ GmbH, and an invoice showing delivery to CSA — that CUSA purchased printers from Océ GmbH and in turn sold them to CSA. There is, in short, no dispute that since 2013 the products at issue were' “sold” by CUSA to CSA. Accordingly, any subsequent sales by CSA are protected by the doctrine of patent exhaustion.\nDefendants argue that these sales by CSA are not protected by the doctrine since CSA offered to sell -the products before it purchased them from CUSA. As explained by the defendants, CSA receives purchase orders from consumers before it orders the corresponding, products from CUSA. Therefore, defendants argue, any subsequent sale of printers to CSA aré not “authorized” for purposes of patent exhaustion because CSA has already engaged in infringing activity. This argument is misguided.\nThe defendants are correct that “[a]n offer to sell is a distinct act of infringement separate from an actual sale.” Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling, Inc. v. Maersk Contractors USA, Inc., 617 F.3d 1296, 1308 (Fed.Cir.2010). “[W]hoever without authority ... ' offers to sell[ ] or sells any patented invention[] within the United States ... infringes the patent.” 35 U.S.C. § 271(a). Making the offer a separate act of infringement serves “to prevent generating interest in a potential infringing product to the commercial detriment of the rightful patentee.” Transocean, 617 F.3d at 1309 (citation omitted).\nCSA’s offers to sell the patented systems did not violate 35 U.S.C. § 271(a) so long as all of the systems it did’ sell were purchased from CUSA or another licensed entity. Any other result would eviscerate CUSA’s license, in particular its retroactive effect. The defendants’ argument is premised on its contention that CUSA was not a properly licensed seller of thé patented products. Accordingly, since the' sales by CUSA were non-infciriging sales, these sales exhausted defendants’ patent rights in the printers. Any offer to sell the printers was an offer to sell non-infringing printers.\nNor does defendants’ analogy to Honeywell Int’l, Inc. v. United States, 609 F.3d 1292 (Fed.Cir.2010), support their claim that CSA’s offers to sell defeat the doctrine of patent exhaustion. In Honeywell, the court concluded that a party’s purchase of a patent after it sold infringing articles did not “retroactively authorize th[ose] earlier sale[s]” and thus retroactively trigger patent exhaustion. Id. at 1304. The Honeywell court did not construe the language of any licensing agreement to determine whether the agreement had granted a retroactive license that would bar infringement claims for subsequent sales.\nIII. Covenant of Good Faith, and Fair Dealing\nPlaintiffs also move for summary judgment on defendants’ counterclaim that CINC breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. That motion is also granted.\n“Under New York law, a covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implicit in all contracts during the course of contract performance.’’ Tractebel Energy Mktg., Inc. v. AEP Power Mktg., Inc., 487 F.3d 89, 98 (2d Cir.2007). “This covenant is breached when a party to a contract acts in a manner that, although not expressly forbidden by any Contractual provision, would deprive the other party of the right to receive the benefits under their agreement,” Refreshment Mgmt. Servs., Corp. v. Complete Office Supply Warehouse Corp., 89 A.D.3d 913, 933 N.Y.S.2d 312, 315 (2d Dep’t 2011.) (citation omitted), that is, the right to receive “the fruits of the[ir] contract.” Sec. Plans, Inc. v. CUNA Mut. Ins. Soc., 769 F.3d 807, 817 (2d Cir.2014) (citation omitted). “The. doctrine is employed when necessary to effectuate the intentions of the parties, or to protect their reasonable expectations.” Gaia House Mezz LLC v. State St. Bank & Trust Co., 720 F.3d 84, 93 (2d Cir.2013) (citation omitted). “Since there is a presumption that all parties act in good faith, the burden of proving a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is on the person asserting the absence of good faith.” Tractebel Energy, 487 F.3d at 98.\n“The covenant will be breached only in a narrow range of cases.” Sec. Plans, Inc., 769 F.3d at 817. “[T]he plaintiff must allege facts which tend to show that the defendant sought to prevent performance of the contract or .to withhold its benefits from the plaintiff.” Aventine Inv. Mgmt., Inc. v. Can. Imperial Bank of Commerce, 265 A.D.2d 513, 697 N.Y.S.2d 128, 130 (2d Dep’t 1999). The implied covenant does not, however; “undermine a party’s general right to act on its own- interests in a way that may incidentally lessen the other party’s expected benefit,” Sec. Plans, Inc., 769 F.3d at 817 (citation omitted), and cannot be used to “imply an obligation inconsistent with other terms of a contractual relationship.” Gaia House, 720 F.3d at 93.\nDefendants argue that plaintiffs violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by contravening the clear intent of the Agreement’s provisions when read as a whole. Specifically, defendants contend that CSA’s sales of Oeé printers effectively circumvent thé Agreemént’s “implied covenant” that the plaintiffs will not interfere with Tesseron’s receipt of royalties from “third-party major competitors.”\nDefendants cannot succeed on this claim as a matter of law. To establish a violation of the covenant, defendants must show that CINC “destroyed] or injur[ed]” Tes-seron’s right “to receive the fruits of the contract.” Sec. Plans, Inc., 769 F.3d at 817 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). Tes-seron’s “fruit[ ] of the contract” was the up-front royalty payment, which it indisputably received. Through execution of the Agreement, Tesseron did not obtain the right to license third-party “major competitors.”\nNor does the Agreement contain the implied covenant suggested by defendants. To the contrary, the Agreement does not restrict either the sellers from whom CINC or its sublicensees may purchase Licensed Products, or the buyers to whom CINC or its sublicensees may sell Licensed Products. The Agreement even protects third-party major competitors against Tesseron’s claims of infringement for any sales made to CINC and its Affiliates, whether those sales were made before or during the term of the Agreement. The Agreement also allowed. CINC to sublicense later-acquired Affiliates who were major competitors, of Tesseron so long as they were not major competitors on December 31, 2005. Accordingly, an examination of the Agreement’s terms does not reveal the existence of the “implied covenant” on which the defendants rely. Indeed, the covenant described by the defendants would “imply an obligation inconsistent with other terms of a contractual relationship.” Gaia House, 720 F.3d at 93.\nCONCLUSION\nPlaintiffs’ September. 23, 2015 motion for summary judgment on them two claims for declaratory judgment — on the validity of the 2015 Sublicense and the issue of patent exhaustion — as well as on defendants’ counterclaim for violation of the good faith and fair dealing is granted.\n. Océ N.V. has since been renamed Océ Holding B.V. Both entities will be referred to as “Océ”.\n. This Opinion does not address any allegedly infringing sales by Océ to the plaintiffs prior to 2013.\n. As of the effective date, Electronics for Imaging Inc. (\""EFI”) supplied printer controller components that CINC was considering using in its own systems in 2005.\n.\""Licensed Products” are defined in Section 1.0Í as “any products, devices, apparatus, systems, ... components, subassemblies, subsystems, software programs and/or other items of any form, type or kind, the ... selling [or] offering for sale ... of which would constitute, but for the license granted herein, infringement of any claim of the [Patents].” (Emphasis added.)\n. \""Affiliate” is defined in § 1.01 as \""any corporation, company, partnership or other entity (a) which is controlled by or is in common control with Canon directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries as of the Effective Date” or \"".(b) which will be controlled by or under common control with Canon directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries subsequent to the Effective Date and which as of the Effective Date is not a major competitor with respect to the [Patents].”,\n. ‘\""[P]atentee’ includes the patentee, to .whom the patent was.issued and the ’successors in title’ to the patentee. The ’successor in title’ is the party holding legal title to the patent.” Morrow, 499 F.3d at 1339 (citation omitted).\n. Davis, a copyright case, draws heavily upon and applies principles of, patent law in reaching. its decision because \""[l]icenses in patent and copyright function similarly.” 505 F.3d at 104.'\n. The holding of that earlier, case, Schering Corp. v. Roussel-UCLAF SA, 104 F.3d 341 (Fed.Cir.1997), is narrow. Schering holds only that \""the grant of a license by one co-owner cannot deprive the other co-owner of the right to sue for, accrued damages for past infringement” and that \""the rights of a patent co-owner, absent agreement to the contrary, do not extend to granting a release that would defeat an action by other co-owners to recover damages for past infringement.” Id. at 345.\n. Ethicon has recently been cited for the \""principle” that \""a license to a third party only operates prospectively.\"" STC.UNM v. Intel Corp., 754 F.3d 940, 945 (Fed.Cir.2014) (citing Ethicon, 135 F.3d at 1467). The discussion in Intel Corp., however, was addressed explicitly to a discussion of co-owners' licensing rights. Intel Corp., 754 F.3d at 944-45.\n. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d), the defendants have requested to depose the signatories of the 2015 Sublicense about their knowledge of the 2006 sublicense. Because the validity of the 2015 Sublicense does not hinge on knowledge of the 2006 oral sublicense or any of the other circumstances surrounding the new grant that defendants have identified, their request for additional depositions is denied.\n. The defendants emphasize that § 2.03 refers to EFI, which is a component manufacturer, But, this reference does not suggest a more restrictive reading of the term “suppliers.” The Agreement states that the suppliers included are \""without limitation,” and the canon of eiusdem generis applies only to \""general terms that follow specific ones,” not the other way around.

The parties now dispute the éffectiveness of a retroactive sublicense that the licensee recently granted to one of its affiliates; Finding that the issuance of a retroactivé sublicense does not violate the terms of the licensing agreement, this Opinion grants the licensee’s motion for summary judgment.\nThe patent holders are defendants Tes-serson Ltd. (“Tesseron”), Industrial Print Technologies L.L.C. (“IPT”), and Forrest P. Gauthier (“Gauthier”; collectively, “defendants”). They seek a declaratory judgment that the plaintiffs’ purported subli-cense is invalid as well as damages for the plaintiffs’ sale-in this country of high speed industrial-sized printing presses manufactured by the Netherlands-based company Océ N.V., which the defendants assert contain components that infringe the defendants’ patents (the “Patents”). •\nThe defendants’ licensee is plaintiff Canon Inc. (“CINC”). CINC asserts that, as permitted by its 2006 license agreement with Tesseron (“Agreement”), it issued an oral sublicense to its subsidiary Canon U.S.A. (“CUSA”) in 2006. Since the existence of that oral sublicense is a hotly disputed question of fact, CINC recently executed a. written\' sublicense to CUSA (“2015 Sublicense”). This motion practice addresses, inter alia, the retroactive effect of that 2015 Sublicense.\nIf the 2015 Sublicense has retroactive effect, the plaintiffs contend that the Subli-cense covers the purchase and resale by CUSA of Océ printing presses from 2013 to the present. CUSA importéd the Océ presses and resold them to its affiliate Canon Solutions America, Inc. (“CSA”). Although a CINC affiliate, and as further explained below, CSA is n.ot an eligible sublicensee pursuant to the Agreement.\nAccordingly, CINC asserts that the sales of Océ products in the United States that have been made since 2013 — products purchased and imported by CUSA from Océ — are authorized by its Agreement with the defendants and that no additional licensing fees must be paid. The defendants disagree. The critical facts that serve as background to this dispute follow.\nBACKGROUND\nThe following, facts are undisputed, unless otherwise noted. In January 2006, Tesseron and CINC executed the patent licensing Agreement. , The Agreement grants CINC a “fully paid-up, nonexclusive, license ... to ... sell ... import ... and/or otherwise dispose of’ products re-latéd to and derived from the Patents. The license explicitly covers the sales of infringing products to CINC, including claims of infringement against CINC’s suppliers arising from the sales to CINC and its authorized affiliates. Section 2.03 states that Tesseron\nagrees not to assert any of its rights under the Licensed Patents against any direct or indirect suppliers of [CINC] and its Affiliates including, without limitation, Electronics for Imaging Inc. for infringement or alleged infringement ... of any Licensed Patents only to the extent of the Licensed Products which have been purchased by [CINC]\' or such Affiliates during the term\nof the Agreement. The Agreement also includes broad releases for CINC, its Affiliates, and their “direct or indirect suppliers,” extinguishing past liability for “infringement or alleged infringement ... to the extent of the Licensed Products which have been purchased by [CINC] or such Affiliates at any time prior to the Effective Date.” The Agreement identifies the Effective Date as December 31, 2005.\nThe Agreement allows CINC to extend the license to any of its current affiliates and to any future affiliates so long as the future affiliate is not a “major competitor” of Tesseron as of the effective date of the Agreement. The affiliates may not, however, extend additional sublicenses. Specifically, Section 2.02 grants CINC the right, “subject to compliance with the terms and conditions” of the Agreement, “to grant to any ... Affiliates sublicenses under the licenses granted to it under this Agreement but without any right to sublicense further.”\n.The Agreement is retroactive, stating that it is effective as of December 31, 2005, and that it extinguishes liability for any claims regarding past infringement. It is governed by the laws of the State of New York. Read as a whole, the Agreement represents a broad grant of rights to CINC and its Affiliates, including releases from liability for their suppliers. The term of the Agreement extends through the life of the Patents.\nCINC wholly owns CUSA; CUSA was at all relevant times an “Affiliate” of CINC as that term is defined in the Agreement. Plaintiffs previously offered evidence that CINC orally issued a sublicense to CUSA during a meeting between representatives of CINC and CUSA in Tokyo on January 31, 2006. That sublicense was purportedly retroactive to December 31, 2005. Plaintiffs acknowledge that no documents or other contemporaneous corroborating evidence of this oral agreement have been located. The existence of the oral subli-cense presents a disputed issue of fact that may only be resolved at trial. See Canon Inc. v. Tesseron Ltd., No. 14cv5462 (DLC), 2015 WL 4508334 (S.D.N.Y. July 24, 2015) [“Summary Judgment Opinion”].\nAs. of December, 31, 2005, which is the effective date of the Agreement, Océ wholly owned two subsidiaries: Océ North America Inc. (“Océ NA”), which sold Océ printers in the United States, and Océ-Printing Systems GmbH and Co. (“Océ GmbH”), which designed and manufactured Océ printers. All three Océ entities were major competitors of Tesseron as of the Agreement’s effective date. Accordingly, in the event one or more of them ever became an affiliate of CINC, the Océ entities would be ineligible to receive subli-censes under the Agreement.\nIn March 2010, CINC acquired a majority ownership in Océ, and on January 1, 2013, CINC merged its subsidiary Canon Business -Solutions, Inc. with Océ NA, forming CSA. Canon has since acquired 100% control or ownership of Océ and Océ GmbH. Since CSA was created on January 1, 2013, CSA has sold Océ printers to consumers, but has not purchased the printers directly from Océ GmbH. Instead, CSA orders Océ printers from CUSA, which purchases the printers from Océ GmbH.\nIn January 2014, IPT, the current owner of right and title in the Patents, sued both CUSA and CSA in the United States District Court for- the Eastern District of Texas for patent infringement due to the sale of Océ printers through CSA. On January 27, 2015, the Texas action was transferred to this Court as related to the instant case. Industrial Print Technologies, L.L.C. v. Canon U.S.A., Inc. and Canon Solutions America, Inc., No. 15cv672 (DLC).\nPlaintiffs filed the instant action in this Court on July 21, 2014. Their complaint asserts six claims; among others, it asserts claims of breach of contract for improper termination of the Agreement; a declaratory judgment that CUSA holds a valid sub-license under the Agreement; and a declaratory judgment that IPT’s patent fights are exhausted with respect to CUSA sales to CSA. Defendants have brought three counterclaims: a declaratory judgment that any purported sublicense to CUSA is invalid; a declaratory judgment that their termination- of the Agreement- was proper; and a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\nFollowing the Summary Judgment Opinion’s conclusion that .the existence of the 2006 oral sublicense between CINC and CUSA presents a disputed issue of fact, CINC and CUSA entered into a written sublicensing agreement with an effective date of December 31, 2005. CINC signed the 2015 Sublicense on September 14 and CUSA signed it on September 16, 2015. Section 2.02 of the 2015 Sublicense purports -.to “grant[ ] to CUSA, effective retroactively to December 31, 2005,” a subli-cense with all rights attaching thereto.\nOn September 23, 2015, the plaintiffs renewed their motion for partial summary judgment to obtain declarations that the 2015 Sublicense is a valid sublicense under the Agreement and that, as a consequence, defendants’ patent rights in the products CUSA sells to CSA are exhausted. Plaintiffs also seek summary judgment on defendants’ claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The motion was fully submitted on October 16.\nOn October 23, defendants sought leave by letter motion to file a surreply. In that surreply, they argue that the meaning of the term “supplier” in\'the Agreement is ambiguous. That argument is addressed below.\nDISCUSSION\nThe standard\'that governs a summary judgment motion . is well settled. The Court’s previous description of that standard is incorporated by reference. Summary Judgment Opinion, 2015 WL 4508334, at *3-4;\nThe parties contest whether plaintiffs have the right to renew their motion for summary judgment based on the plaintiffs’ recent execution of the 2015 Subli-cense. “[District courts enjoy considerable discretion in entertaining successive dis-positive motions,” Sira v. Morton, 380 F.3d 57, 68 (2d Cir.2004), “particularly when the moving party has expanded the factual record on which summary judgment is sought.” Brown v. City of Syracuse, 673 F.3d 141, 147 n. 2 (2d Cir.2012) (citation omitted). This renewed motion is brought within the time scheduled for summary judgment motion practice and will be addressed as a timely motion.\nI. Validity of Retroactive Sublicense\nPlaintiffs first move for summary judgment and a declaration that the 2015 Subli-cense is valid. It has previously been determined that, CINC is not required to obtain permission from Tesseron before issuing any sublicense. Summary Judgment Opinion, 2015 WL 4508334, at *5. Moreover, the Agreement does not bar a retroactive sublicense. After all, the Agreement itself is retroactive and contemplated that CINC could immediately extend subli-censes to all of its current Affiliates, presumably also for retroactive terms, and could extend sublicenses as well to a category of future Affiliates. The defendants contend, however, that federal patent law bars retroactive licenses. It does not, at least in the circumstances that pertain here. To support their argument the defendants rely on caselaw that pertains to eo-owned patents and othér intellectual property; that caselaw is inapposite.\nThe basic principles of patent licensing are well established. They begin with the rights that accrue to ownership\'of a patent. “A patent grant bestows the legal right to exclude others from making, using, selling, or offering to sell the patented invention in the United States, or importing the invention.” Morrow v. Microsoft Corp., 499 F.3d 1332, 1339 (Fed.Cir.2007) (citing 35 U.S.C. § 154; 35 U.S.C. § 271). “[The] right to exclude is the legal interest[,] created by statute” and belonging originally to the patentee (or patentees). Id. These interests and rights in the patent carry with them the. right to sue patent infringers. 35 U.S.C. § 281. “A patent is, in effect, a bundle of rights which may be divided and assigned, or retained in whole or part,” Alfred E. Mann Found. For Scientific Research v. Cochlear Corp., 604 F.3d 1354, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2010) (citation omitted), and the right to sue is “one of the most valuable ’sticks’ of the bundle.” Davis v. Blige, 505 F.3d 90, 103 (2d Cir.2007) (citation omitted) (copyright).\nAs with any other property, the full panoply of legal rights and interests attached to a patent may be conveyed to another by transfer or assignment. A limited conveyance of rights may also be accomplished through a license, which may be either an exclusive or nonexclusive license. “[A]lthough all the various rights available under [a] patent are initially held by the named inventor or inventors, they may, as a result of licensing\' agreements and assignments, become separated and be held by multiple individuals.” Alfred E. Mann Found., 604 F.3d at 1360.\nAn exclusive license “carries with it the right to prevent others from practicing the invention.” Morrow, 499 F.3d at 1340. The holder of an exclusive license “comes so close to having truly proprietary interests -in the patent,” Ortho Pharm. Corp. v. Genetics Inst., Inc., 52 F.3d 1026, 1032 (Fed.Cir.1995) (citation omitted), that she is entitled to enforce the patent’s monopoly through the courts—but only “through or in the name of the owner of th\'e patent,” who ordinarily must be joined in any action. Morrow, 499 F.3d at 1340 (citation omitted).\nBy contrast, a nonexclusive license, in its barest form, is just “a covenant by the patent owner not to.sue the licensee for making, using, or selling the patented invention and under which the patent owner reserves the right to grant similar licenses to other entities.” TransCore, LP v. Elec. Transaction Consultants Corp., 563 F.3d 1271, 1276 (Fed.Cir.2009) (citation omitted). Nonexclusive licenses may include provisions granting other rights in the patent, including a right to sublicense. Cf. Intel Corp. v. U.S. Int’l Trade Comm’n, 946 F.2d 821, 826 n. 9 (Fed.Cir.1991).\nThe freedom to license a patent or to sue for infringement of a patent is more restricted, however, when a patent is held by co-owners. Although each co-owiier “is ordinarily , free” to sell a patented invention without regard to the wishes of any other co-owner and to license others to: do so, the right to license others is limited to the right to grant a prospective license. See, e.g., Schering Corp. v. Roussel-UCLAF SA, 104 F.3d 341, 344-45 (Fed.Cir.1997) (citing. 35 U.S.C. § 262). Similarly, a co-owner, may not sue for infringement without joining all other co-owners. STC.UNM v. Intel Corp., 754 F.3d 940, 944 (Fed.Cir.2014), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1700, 191 L.Ed.2d 676 (2015). This limitation of rights is subject to alteration by contract. Patent co-owners may grant each other “the right to«bring suit for infringement of the patent without the other co-owner’s voluntarily joining-the suit.” Schering, 104 F.3d at 344.\nThe restriction on a co-owner’s right to grant a retroactive license arises from two concerns. First, retroactive licensing would undermine the unconsenting co-owner’s right to sue:\nUnlike a settlement, which recognizes\'an unauthorized use but waives a settling owner’s accrued claims, of liability, a retroactive license or assignment would — if given legal effect — erase the unauthorized use\' from history with the result that the nonparty co-owner’s right to sue for infringement, which accrues when the infringement first occurs; -is extinguished.-\nDavis, 505 F.3d at 103. Thus, “[a] rule permitting retroactive licenses or assignments” could extinguish “one of the most valuable ’sticks’ of the ’bundle of rights.’” Id. (citation omitted).\nSecondly, the inability of a co-owner to unilaterally grant a retroactive license promotes predictability and certainty and discourages infringement. As explained by Davis, if a co-owner could unilaterally grant a retroactive license whenever it wished,- “one could never reliably and definitively determine if and when infringement occurred, because an infringement could be ’undone’ by” one co-owner’s grant of a retroactive license;- for another, •\none could never know who the pool of authorized users or licensors ... would be at -any given time, because a retroac-five transfer could always turn an in-fringer- into a potential user or licensor, who would then have the ability to grant his own retroactive licenses or retrans-fer his new (retroactive) interest retroactively.\nDavis, 505 F.3d at 105. Were retroactive licensing permitted, the court explains,\n[a]n infringer could “buy” his way out of an infringement suit, in which an injured owner may seek enhanced statutory damages and costs... by paying a single co-owner for a license or assigned copyright interest, A retroactive license or assignment that can be obtained from a co-owner not bringing suit, or one willing to settle for a lower price than the co-owner bringing the action, is likely to cost, much less than the value of the copyright interest including the cost of litigation. The result is that infringement is encouraged and rewarded. .\nId. at 106.\nDefendants cite .language in Ethicon, Inc. v. U.S. Surgical Corp., 135 F.3d 1456 (Fed.Cir.1998), as well as Davis to assert that all retroactive patent licenses are forbidden, Yet these cases do not support that proposition.\nThe patent owners in Ethicon were co-owners, 135 F,3d at 1466. Moreover, the portion of Ethicon with the relevant discussion relies wholly upon an earlier case whose reasoning was explicitly addressed to co-ownership; moreover, Ethicon was careful to acknowledge that certain “retroactive licenses of patent rights have been enforced” for patents with “sole owners.” Id. at 1467 n.8.\nAs far as the Davis case is concerned, neither the legal principles nor public policy undergirding the opinion recommend a reading that would indiscriminately ban all copyright- or patent-holders, even solé owners, from voluntarily entering into retroactive license agreements. \'As the Honorable Robert W. Sweet has explained, “the holding in Davis was a narrow one that does not apply to” unless licensing rights are held by co-owners. Spinelli v. Nat\'l Football League, 96 F.Supp.3d 81, 124 (S.D.N.Y.2015). The other cases defendants cite — including a District Court case from this District interpreting Davis — are inapposite. For example, in Waterloo Furniture Components, Ltd. v. Haworth, Inc., 467 F.3d 641 (7th Cir.2006), the court determined that a settlement agreement to resolve a claim for past infringement that was entered after the expiration of a patent was not a license. Id. at 647-48. See also N.J. Media Grp. Inc. v. Pirro, No. 13cv7153 (ER), 2015 WL 1086566, at *4 n. 6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2015).\nAccordingly, the discussions in Ethicon and Davis are properly understood as discussions of the scope of licensing rights in the context of co-ownership, not sole ownership, and not as indications of intent to restrict a sophisticated patent holder’s right to negotiate and issue a broad license agreement granting both retrospective and prospective rights. Indeed, any other-reading would represent a- significant restriction on a patent holder’s ability to freely determine by contract any and all exceptions to the right to exclude others from use of her patent.\nMoreover, the arguments against retroactive patent licensing have real force only in the context of co-ownership. Determining -when and if infringement has occurred is not difficult for a sole owner because the sole- owner has the exclusive right to license; past infringement cannot be “undone” by someone with an equal, unrestricted right to license. And the problem of knowing all\' authorized, users or li-censors “at any given time” need not arise when sole owners voluntarily grant retroactive licenses. The out-of-control spread of retroactive sublicenses, and hence uncertainty about the number of authorized users, can be controlled by a sole owner, who may impose contractual limitations on the right of a licensee to grant a sublicense or a sublicense with retroactive effect. In sum, the logic of prohibiting the right to issue retroactive licenses does not apply unless there is a co-owner.\n‘ Accordingly, whether a license or sublicense may have retroactive effect depends upon whether the licensor has conferred that right. This is a question of contract interpretation.\nConstruction of a patent “licensing agreement is solely a matter of state law.” Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U.S. 653, 661-62, 89 S.Ct. 1902, 23 L.Ed.2d 610 (1969). The Agreement’s choice of law clause selected New York’s as its governing law. Under New York law, “agreements are to be construed in accordance with the parties’ intent,” “the, best evidence” of which “is what they say in their writing.” In re World Trade Ctr. Disaster Site Litig., 754 F.3d 114, 122 (2d Cir.2014) (citation omitted). “Accordingly, a written agreement that is complete, clear and unambiguous on its face must be enforced according to the plain meaning of its terms.” Id. (citation omitted). Thus, “[a]t the outset, the court must determine whether the language the parties have chosen is ambiguous .... ” Gary Friedrich Enterprises, LLC v. Marvel Characters, Inc., 716 F.3d 302, 313 (2d Cir.2013). “[A]n omission ... in a contract does not constitute an ambiguity.” Jade Realty LLC v. Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2005-EMG, 83 A.D.3d 567, 922 N.Y.S.2d 37, 39 (1st Dep’t 2011) (citation omitted), aff\'d, 20 N.Y.3d 881, 957 N.Y.S.2d 280, 980 N.E.2d 945 (2012).\nHere, Tesseron executed a retroactive license with CINC. The Agreement, which was executed on dates in mid-January 2006, acknowledges that it applies retroactively to December 31, 2005, and relieves CINC of all liability for importing, using and selling the licensed products both before December 31, 2005 and until the expiration of the Patents. Read as a whole, the Agreement also permits CINC to grant retroactive sublicenses.\nSection 2.02 of the Agreement governs sublicensing. It limits CINC’s right to sublicense in two specific ways: CINC may sublicense only to Affiliates, as that term is defined in the Agreement, and may not grant those Affiliates the right to sublicense further. It does not restrict the right to sublicense to a grant of prospective licenses. “[I]f parties to a contract omit terms ... the inescapable conclusion is that the parties intended the omission.” Quadrant Structured Products Co. v. Vertin, 23 N.Y.3d 549, 560, 992 N.Y.S.2d 687 (2014). The presence of two sublicensing restrictions and the absence of a provision prohibiting retroactive sublicensing demonstrates that these sophisticated parties chose not to include one. See id. (“[W]here [a] sophisticated drafter omits a term, ex-pressio unius precludes the court from implying it from the general language of the agreement.”).\nFurthermore, the ability to sublicense retroactively is woven into the fabric of the Agreement. The Agreement extinguishes any liability for past infringement on the part of both CINC and its Affiliates. Section 3.01 of the Agreement extinguishes liability for any claims against CINC “and all of the Affiliates [that] have been made, might have been made or might be made at any time prior to the Effective Date.” Indeed, since CINC may issue a sublicense to Affiliates it acquires at any time during the term of the Agreement (as long as later-acquired Affiliates were not major competitors of Tesseron as of the Agreement’s effective date), and the Agreement grants such an Affiliate the full measure of rights under Section 2.01, the Agreement necessarily authorizes retroactive subli-censes.\nThe defendants offer three arguments to support their assertion that the Agreement does not permit a retroactive license and that the 2015 Sublicense is invalid. First, they contend that the parties’ choice of an effective date that was some weeks prior to the execution of the Agreement was simply “an administrative detail” and should not be used as evidence that they extended a retroactive license. But, as described above, the Agreement grants retroactive licenses that cover more than just those few weeks between the effective date and the execution dates. The one-time fee licensed a broad swath of historic and prospective activity for both CINC and its Affiliates.\nDefendants also argue that the 2015 Sublicense is invalid because it represents an improper attempt to settle a dispute of material fact. The 2015 Sublicense includes several provisions purporting to “remove all doubts as to CINC’s grant to CUSA of a full sublicense” in January 2006. Defendants are correct that the 2015 Sublicense cannot resolve the factual dispute over the creation of the 2006 oral sublicense. That factual dispute, however, is mooted by the 2015 Sublicense. The 2015 Sublicense explicitly “grants to CUSA, effective retroactively to December 31, 2005, a fully paid-up non-exclusive sublicense.” That grant does not depend in any way upon whether the 2006 oral sublicense exists.\nFinally, the defendants contend that the 2015 Sublicense, even if valid, cannot encompass the Océ printing presses since the Agreement only licenses component parts and not a complete system. Specifically, defendants point to § 2.03, in which Tes-seron waived its right to assert patent infringement claims against any “supplier of Canon and its Affiliates.” They assert that the term supplier is ambiguous, and that it could refer solely to suppliers of component parts and as opposed to Océ, which supplied CUSA with complete printing presses. Read in the context of the entire Agreement, however, “supplier” is unambiguous and refers to a much broader range of suppliers.\nSection 2.03 states that Tesseron “agrees not to assert any of its rights under the [Patents] against any direct or indirect suppliers of [CINC] and its Affiliates including, without limitation, [EFI] for infringement or alleged infringement ... to the extent of the Licensed Products which have been purchased by [CINC] or such Affiliates” during the term of the Agreement. (Emphasis added.) Thus, “suppliers” refers to suppliers from whom CINC or its Affiliates purchase “Licensed Products.” The definition of “Licensed Products” explicitly includes “any products [or], systems” — precisely what defendants claim the term “suppliers” cannot refer to — as well as “components.” Indeed, the Agreement explains that ,Tesseron’s own patented device is a “system.” Accordingly, because § 2.03 unambiguously provides that. Tesseron will not assert its rights against any suppliers that sell to CINC and its Affiliates systems that rely upon the Patents, the 2015 Sublicense covers the Océ printing presses that CUSA sold to CSA. .\nII. Patent Exhaustion\nPlaintiffs also seek summary judgment on their claim for a declaration that the Patents are\' exhausted with respect to the sales by CSA of the licensed products they purchase from CUSA. The parties agree on the underlying legal principle that must be applied.\n“Patent exhaustion is a judicially fashioned doctrine,” JVC Kenwood Corp. v. Nero, Inc., 797 F.3d 1039, 1047 (Fed.Cir.2015) (citation omitted). “The longstanding doctrine of patent exhaustion provides that the initial authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item.” Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., 553 U.S. 617, 625, 128 S.Ct. 2109, 170 L.Ed.2d 996 (2008). “[B]y exhausting the patentee’s monopoly in that item, the sale confers on the purchaser, or any subsequent owner, the right to use or sell the thing as he sees fit.” Bowman v. Monsanto Co., — U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1761, 1766, 185 L.Ed.2d 931, 941 (2013) (citation omitted).\nPlaintiffs have offered evidence — including purchase orders between Océ GmbH and\' CUSA and between CUSA and CSA, a customs invoicé from Océ GmbH, and an invoice showing delivery to CSA — that CUSA purchased printers from Océ GmbH and in turn sold them to CSA. There is, in short, no dispute that since 2013 the products at issue were\' “sold” by CUSA to CSA. Accordingly, any subsequent sales by CSA are protected by the doctrine of patent exhaustion.\nDefendants argue that these sales by CSA are not protected by the doctrine since CSA offered to sell -the products before it purchased them from CUSA. As explained by the defendants, CSA receives purchase orders from consumers before it orders the corresponding, products from CUSA. Therefore, defendants argue, any subsequent sale of printers to CSA aré not “authorized” for purposes of patent exhaustion because CSA has already engaged in infringing activity. This argument is misguided.\nThe defendants are correct that “[a]n offer to sell is a distinct act of infringement separate from an actual sale.” Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling, Inc. v. Maersk Contractors USA, Inc., 617 F.3d 1296, 1308 (Fed.Cir.2010). “[W]hoever without authority ... \' offers to sell[ ] or sells any patented invention[] within the United States ... infringes the patent.” 35 U.S.C. § 271(a). Making the offer a separate act of infringement serves “to prevent generating interest in a potential infringing product to the commercial detriment of the rightful patentee.” Transocean, 617 F.3d at 1309 (citation omitted).\nCSA’s offers to sell the patented systems did not violate 35 U.S.C. § 271(a) so long as all of the systems it did’ sell were purchased from CUSA or another licensed entity. Any other result would eviscerate CUSA’s license, in particular its retroactive effect. The defendants’ argument is premised on its contention that CUSA was not a properly licensed seller of thé patented products. Accordingly, since the\' sales by CUSA were non-infciriging sales, these sales exhausted defendants’ patent rights in the printers. Any offer to sell the printers was an offer to sell non-infringing printers.\nNor does defendants’ analogy to Honeywell Int’l, Inc. v. United States, 609 F.3d 1292 (Fed.Cir.2010), support their claim that CSA’s offers to sell defeat the doctrine of patent exhaustion. In Honeywell, the court concluded that a party’s purchase of a patent after it sold infringing articles did not “retroactively authorize th[ose] earlier sale[s]” and thus retroactively trigger patent exhaustion. Id. at 1304. The Honeywell court did not construe the language of any licensing agreement to determine whether the agreement had granted a retroactive license that would bar infringement claims for subsequent sales.\nIII. Covenant of Good Faith, and Fair Dealing\nPlaintiffs also move for summary judgment on defendants’ counterclaim that CINC breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. That motion is also granted.\n“Under New York law, a covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implicit in all contracts during the course of contract performance.’’ Tractebel Energy Mktg., Inc. v. AEP Power Mktg., Inc., 487 F.3d 89, 98 (2d Cir.2007). “This covenant is breached when a party to a contract acts in a manner that, although not expressly forbidden by any Contractual provision, would deprive the other party of the right to receive the benefits under their agreement,” Refreshment Mgmt. Servs., Corp. v. Complete Office Supply Warehouse Corp., 89 A.D.3d 913, 933 N.Y.S.2d 312, 315 (2d Dep’t 2011.) (citation omitted), that is, the right to receive “the fruits of the[ir] contract.” Sec. Plans, Inc. v. CUNA Mut. Ins. Soc., 769 F.3d 807, 817 (2d Cir.2014) (citation omitted). “The. doctrine is employed when necessary to effectuate the intentions of the parties, or to protect their reasonable expectations.” Gaia House Mezz LLC v. State St. Bank & Trust Co., 720 F.3d 84, 93 (2d Cir.2013) (citation omitted). “Since there is a presumption that all parties act in good faith, the burden of proving a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is on the person asserting the absence of good faith.” Tractebel Energy, 487 F.3d at 98.\n“The covenant will be breached only in a narrow range of cases.” Sec. Plans, Inc., 769 F.3d at 817. “[T]he plaintiff must allege facts which tend to show that the defendant sought to prevent performance of the contract or .to withhold its benefits from the plaintiff.” Aventine Inv. Mgmt., Inc. v. Can. Imperial Bank of Commerce, 265 A.D.2d 513, 697 N.Y.S.2d 128, 130 (2d Dep’t 1999). The implied covenant does not, however; “undermine a party’s general right to act on its own- interests in a way that may incidentally lessen the other party’s expected benefit,” Sec. Plans, Inc., 769 F.3d at 817 (citation omitted), and cannot be used to “imply an obligation inconsistent with other terms of a contractual relationship.” Gaia House, 720 F.3d at 93.\nDefendants argue that plaintiffs violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by contravening the clear intent of the Agreement’s provisions when read as a whole. Specifically, defendants contend that CSA’s sales of Oeé printers effectively circumvent thé Agreemént’s “implied covenant” that the plaintiffs will not interfere with Tesseron’s receipt of royalties from “third-party major competitors.”\nDefendants cannot succeed on this claim as a matter of law. To establish a violation of the covenant, defendants must show that CINC “destroyed] or injur[ed]” Tes-seron’s right “to receive the fruits of the contract.” Sec. Plans, Inc., 769 F.3d at 817 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). Tes-seron’s “fruit[ ] of the contract” was the up-front royalty payment, which it indisputably received. Through execution of the Agreement, Tesseron did not obtain the right to license third-party “major competitors.”\nNor does the Agreement contain the implied covenant suggested by defendants. To the contrary, the Agreement does not restrict either the sellers from whom CINC or its sublicensees may purchase Licensed Products, or the buyers to whom CINC or its sublicensees may sell Licensed Products. The Agreement even protects third-party major competitors against Tesseron’s claims of infringement for any sales made to CINC and its Affiliates, whether those sales were made before or during the term of the Agreement. The Agreement also allowed. CINC to sublicense later-acquired Affiliates who were major competitors, of Tesseron so long as they were not major competitors on December 31, 2005. Accordingly, an examination of the Agreement’s terms does not reveal the existence of the “implied covenant” on which the defendants rely. Indeed, the covenant described by the defendants would “imply an obligation inconsistent with other terms of a contractual relationship.” Gaia House, 720 F.3d at 93.\nCONCLUSION\nPlaintiffs’ September. 23, 2015 motion for summary judgment on them two claims for declaratory judgment — on the validity of the 2015 Sublicense and the issue of patent exhaustion — as well as on defendants’ counterclaim for violation of the good faith and fair dealing is granted.\n. Océ N.V. has since been renamed Océ Holding B.V. Both entities will be referred to as “Océ”.\n. This Opinion does not address any allegedly infringing sales by Océ to the plaintiffs prior to 2013.\n. As of the effective date, Electronics for Imaging Inc. (""EFI”) supplied printer controller components that CINC was considering using in its own systems in 2005.\n.""Licensed Products” are defined in Section 1.0Í as “any products, devices, apparatus, systems, ... components, subassemblies, subsystems, software programs and/or other items of any form, type or kind, the ... selling [or] offering for sale ... of which would constitute, but for the license granted herein, infringement of any claim of the [Patents].” (Emphasis added.)\n. ""Affiliate” is defined in § 1.01 as ""any corporation, company, partnership or other entity (a) which is controlled by or is in common control with Canon directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries as of the Effective Date” or "".(b) which will be controlled by or under common control with Canon directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries subsequent to the Effective Date and which as of the Effective Date is not a major competitor with respect to the [Patents].”,\n. ‘""[P]atentee’ includes the patentee, to .whom the patent was.issued and the ’successors in title’ to the patentee. The ’successor in title’ is the party holding legal title to the patent.” Morrow, 499 F.3d at 1339 (citation omitted).\n. Davis, a copyright case, draws heavily upon and applies principles of, patent law in reaching. its decision because ""[l]icenses in patent and copyright function similarly.” 505 F.3d at 104.\'\n. The holding of that earlier, case, Schering Corp. v. Roussel-UCLAF SA, 104 F.3d 341 (Fed.Cir.1997), is narrow. Schering holds only that ""the grant of a license by one co-owner cannot deprive the other co-owner of the right to sue for, accrued damages for past infringement” and that ""the rights of a patent co-owner, absent agreement to the contrary, do not extend to granting a release that would defeat an action by other co-owners to recover damages for past infringement.” Id. at 345.\n. Ethicon has recently been cited for the ""principle” that ""a license to a third party only operates prospectively."" STC.UNM v. Intel Corp., 754 F.3d 940, 945 (Fed.Cir.2014) (citing Ethicon, 135 F.3d at 1467). The discussion in Intel Corp., however, was addressed explicitly to a discussion of co-owners\' licensing rights. Intel Corp., 754 F.3d at 944-45.\n. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d), the defendants have requested to depose the signatories of the 2015 Sublicense about their knowledge of the 2006 sublicense. Because the validity of the 2015 Sublicense does not hinge on knowledge of the 2006 oral sublicense or any of the other circumstances surrounding the new grant that defendants have identified, their request for additional depositions is denied.\n. The defendants emphasize that § 2.03 refers to EFI, which is a component manufacturer, But, this reference does not suggest a more restrictive reading of the term “suppliers.” The Agreement states that the suppliers included are ""without limitation,” and the canon of eiusdem generis applies only to ""general terms that follow specific ones,” not the other way around. United States v. Amato, 540 F.3d 153, 160 (2d Cir.2008)\n. The exhibits were submitted with plaintiffs’ previous motion for summary judgment and have been incorporated by reference into their motion papers here.\n, The arguments regarding patent exhaustion -were set forth in the parties’ supplemental briefing on the initial motion for summary judgment on these issues, and were incorporated by reference into the briefing here.\n.Defendants do not suggest that CSA’s offers to sell the printing presses were linked to any sales other them those it had purchased from CUSA. This Opinion does not address a situation in which a seller made offers to sell products for which there had been no initial authorized sale.', 'type': 'majority'}]"

Efremsky, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge\nI. Introduction\nBefore the court are cross-motions for summary judgment by plaintiff Susan L. Uecker, the liquidating trustee appointed under the confirmed plan of Mortgage Fund ’08 LLC (the “Trustee” and “MF08”), and defendant Robert L. Montgomery. This matter has been fully briefed and argued.\nThe Trustee moves for summary judgment on the California Civil Code § 3439.04(a) constructive fraudulent transfer claim in her first amended complaint. Montgomery moves for summary judgment on the affirmative defenses asserted in his answer.\nFor the reasons explained below, the court grants summary adjudication for Montgomery on his affirmative defense regarding the effect of a release in a settlement agreement which effectively moots the remaining summary judgment issues.\nII. Background\nThese motions require a review of certain events in MF08’s chapter 11 case and the chapter 11 case of its affiliate, RE Loans, LLC, which was filed in the Northern District of Texas (Case no. 11-35865-BJH) (“REL”).\nThe following facts are taken from the First Amended Complaint (the “FAC”) (Docket no. 30); Montgomery’s Answer to the FAC (Docket no. 31); the Trustee’s Declaration and Statement of Undisputed Facts (Docket nos. 44-2 and 44-5); Montgomery’s Declaration and Statement of Undisputed Facts (Docket nos. 46-1 and 46-2); and Montgomery’s Request for Judicial Notice (Docket no. 48).\nFor context, the court also takes judicial notice of MF08’s Plan and Disclosure Statement (MF08 Docket nos. 101-102); REL’s Disclosure Statement (REL Docket no. 843); REL’s Plan (REL Docket no. 905); the Declaration of James A. Weis-senborn in Support of Confirmation of the REL Plan (REL Docket no. 943); and the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Confirming the REL Plan (the “REL Confirmation Order”) (REL Docket no. 967). Harris v. Cnty of Orange, 682 F.3d 1126, 1132 (9th Cir.2012) (court may take judicial notice of undisputed matters of public record including documents on file in federal courts).\nA. The Bankruptcy Cases\nMF08’s bankruptcy case was commenced as an involuntary chapter 7 on September 12, 2011. MF08 Docket no. 1. The case was converted to chapter 11 and an order for relief was entered on September 28, 2011. MF08 Docket no. 11. The order approving its Disclosure Statement and confirming its Plan was entered on February 3, 2012 and the Trustee has been in place since that time. MF08 Docket nos. 144-145.\nREL commenced its chapter 11 case in the Northern District of Texas on September 13, 2011. REL Docket no. 1. The REL Confirmation Order was entered on June 26, 2012. As will be explained below, MF08 filed a claim in the REL case which is the genesis for these motions.\nB. Ownership and Operation of MF08 and REL\nWalter Ng and his sons Kelly Ng and Barney Ng owned, managed, and controlled, directly or indirectly, MF08 and REL and their related entities, B-4 Partners, LLC and Bar-K. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 8-10; Docket no. 31, Answer ¶ 8-10; Docket no. 44-5, Uecker Deck Ex. 5 (MF08’s proof of claim filed in REL’s case (the “Proof of Claim”); REL Docket no. 843 (Disclosure Statement). The FAC alleges that Walter and Kelly Ng formed REL in January 2002. REL made secured loans to real estate developers.. To raise money to fund these loans, it sold unregistered securities to investors who became members of REL. By the end of 2006, REL had raised over $700 million, had over 1,400 members and reported more than $55 million cash on hand. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 12; Docket no. 31, Answer ¶ 12; Docket no. 44-10, Sugarman Report. See also, REL Disclosure Statement (REL Docket no. 843); Declaration of James A. Weissenborn in support of confirmation of REL Plan (REL Docket no. 943).\nIn early 2007, REL faced liquidity problems. 'It had been advised by its attorneys that it could not raise more money from new investors- which meant it would then be unable to meet the withdrawal demands of its old investors and meet its funding commitments to its borrowers. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 13-14; Docket no. 44-10, Sugar-man Report at 3-5.\nIn November 2007, REL made its members into noteholders in what is referred to as the “Exchange Transaction” and the issuance of “Exchange Notes.” REL Docket no. 843, Disclosure Statement at 21-22. When it filed its bankruptcy case in September 2011, REL had approximately 2,900 noteholders who were owed approximately $646 million (the “REL Noteholders”). REL Docket no. 843, Disclosure Statement at 22-23. Montgomery is an REL Noteholder,\nIn December 2007, the managers of REL created MF08. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 16; Docket no. 44-10, Sugarman Report at 1. The Mortgage Fund, LLC (“TMF”) was MF08’s sole member and manager; Walter Ng and Kelly Ng were the sole members of TMF and thus controlled MF08. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 8-10; Docket no. 31, Answer ¶ 8-10. REL, MF08, TMF, B-4 Partners, and Bar-K all did business from the same address in Lafayette, California. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 9; Docket no. 31, Answer ¶ 9.\nMF08’s stated purpose was to make secured loans to real estate developers. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 16; Docket no. 44-10, Sugarman Report at 1. MF08 did business much as REL did after the Exchange Transaction. As of its petition date, MF08 had approximately 572 noteholders who were owed approximately $80 million and held a real estate portfolio valued at approximately $72 million. MF08 Docket no. 101, Disclosure Statement at 1-8.\nC. MF08’s $66 Million Proof of Claim in the REL Case\nThe Trustee’s declaration states that “[p]rior to. my appointment as trustee, MF08 asserted that MF08 transferred $66,226,496 to REL and that REL was liable to MF08 in this amount. I continued to assert this claim after my appointment.” Docket no. 44-5, Uecker Dec. ¶ 13-14, Ex. 5 (Proof of Claim). The Proof of Claim describes the MF08 ownership structure as noted above. It asserts:\n[B]etween December 4, 2007, and February 4, 2009, the Ngs caused the aggregate sum of $66,226,496 to be transferred from MF08’s bank accounts to [REL] (the “Cash Transfers”). The Cash Transfers were made either (1) directly to [REL], (2) indirectly through [TMF] or Bar-K, or (3) to [REL’s] borrowers to enable such borrowers to service or repay loans extended to them by [REL].\nDocket no. 44-5, Uecker Dec. Ex. 5 (emphasis added).\nThe Proof of Claim seeks the recovery of the Cash Transfers based on the theory that MF08 made them with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud entities to whom MF08 was or became indebted. It includes a list of each of the Cash Transfers that totals $66,226,496.\nD. MF08 Settlement with REL and Confirmation of the REL Plan\nREL informally objected to MF08’s Proof of Claim. Docket no. 44-5, Uecker Dec. ¶ 14. In April 2012, the principal stakeholders in the ' REL case — REL, Wells Fargo Capital Finance (REL’s secured lender), and the official REL Noteholders’ Committee (representing Montgomery’s interests as a REL Note-holder) — participated in a judicial mediation. They then reached a settlement of the outstanding issues regarding the validity and priority of MF08’s Proof of Claim, along with related issues which allowed REL to proceed to confirmation of its Plan. Docket no. 44-5, Uecker Dec. ¶ 14-15.\nREL filed a motion to obtain court approval of the settlement. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion for Approval of Settlement, REL Docket no. 907 (the “Motion”). Attached to the Motion is an unsigned copy of the settlement agreement between REL and MF08 (the “Settlement Agreement”). Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 9 (Settlement Agreement), REL Docket no. 907-1 (Settlement Agreement).\nThe Motion describes the Proof of Claim and MF08’s fraudulent transfer theory. The Motion defines the “REL Transfers” as the transfer of $66 million made between December 2007 and “approximately August of 2008” and the commingling by REL in its general account with other REL funds. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶ 12-13). MF08 contended that “if it can trace the funds that it transferred to REL from REL to any given [REL] Noteholder, MF08 might have the right to pursue recovery from that [REL] Noteholder as a subsequent transferee pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 550(b).” These are defined as the “MF08 Potential Avoidance Actions.” Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶ 14). The Motion then describes the response by REL and the REL Noteholders Committee:\n[REL] and the Noteholders Committee contend that Noteholders who received the REL Transfers who were not insiders of [REL] cannot be liable to MF08 because (a) it is not possible to trace the dollars received from MF08 to any specific REL Transfer or transferee; and (b) each [REL] Noteholder that received an REL Transfer, with the possible exception of insiders of [REL], received any such REL Transfer on account of a debt payable by [REL] for value, in good faith, and without knowledge of the voidability of the transfer from MF08 to [REL] (even assuming that transfer is avoidable) and, therefore, would be shielded from liability pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 550(b).\nDocket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶ 15) (emphasis added).\nThe Motion then describes the “prior plan compromise” which had been negotiated by REL and the REL Noteholders’ Committee and the change to it which was now required by this proposed settlement with MF08. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶ 16). Essentially, the prior plan compromise provided that if the REL Noteholders voted to accept the plan, the REL Noteholders’ lien on REL assets would be released, they would share pro rata with holders of general unsecured claims and their claims would not be “subordinated or challenged,” but each REL Noteholder’s claim would be reduced by 50% of any cash received after the November 2007 Exchange Transaction through the REL petition date. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶ 16).\nThe proposed deal with MF08 made one change to the “prior plan compromise.” Instead of the REL Noteholders sharing pro rata with the general unsecured creditors, the first $5 million to be distributed was to go to general unsecured creditors before the REL Noteholders would share pro rata. This change increased the distribution to general unsecured creditors— primarily benefitting MF08 as the largest such creditor — and reduced the distribution to REL Noteholders through reallocation of the first $5 million. In exchange for this “enhancement,” MF08 agreed to vote its $66 million claim in favor of the plan. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶ 17). In addition, the Motion states that in exchange, MF08 would waive the right to pursue all MF08 Potential Avoidance Actions against REL Noteholders, and MF08 would be appointed to the trust oversight committee of the liquidating trust to be created under the REL Plan. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶3 (summarizing terms of agreement resolving objection to MF08’s Proof of Claim and the relative treatment of all unsecured claims and the REL Noteholder claims)).\nThe Motion explained that absent this agreement, the parties would be forced to litigate the merits of the MF08 Proof of Claim, the merits of the final plan compromise, the relative priorities and rights as between the holders of general unsecured claims and the REL Noteholders, and the merits of the MF08 Potential Avoidance Actions. This was an unattractive proposition because it would “consume substantial cash that would otherwise be distributable to REL Noteholders and MF08’s creditors.” Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶ 23-25).\nThe Motion also noted that many REL Noteholders were also investors in MF08, and paying the professionals to redistribute the limited funds available as between MF08 and REL would reduce the total amount received by all creditors. Litigating MF08’s Potential Avoidance Actions would also likely be complex and could require expensive efforts to trace funds, and every dollar spent on professionals would reduce the amount available for distribution to creditors. The modified plan eliminated these issues and was supported by all stakeholders, including the committee of MF08’s noteholders. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶ 23-25).\nOn June 18, 2012, the REL bankruptcy court held a hearing on the Motion and granted it. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 11 (Order on Motion). As a result, MF08 obtained allowance of its $66 million claim, the $5 million preferred payment, and a position on the REL trust oversight eom-mittee. The REL Noteholders agreed to reduce the allowed amount of their claims by 50% of what they had been paid between the November 2007 Exchange Transaction and REL’s September 2011 petition date in exchange for a release from potential fraudulent transfer actions. With the REL Noteholders’ and MF08’s support, REL obtained a clear path to confirmation of its Plan.\nE. The Settlement Agreement\nThe Settlement Agreement is an exhibit to the Motion. Of particular concern for these summary judgment motions are the following sections. The recitals in § 2 of the Settlement Agreement provide:\n2.01 MF08 transferred cash in an amount equal to $66,226,496 to [REL] during the period from December of 2007 and through 2008.\n2.02 MF08 contends that [REL] is liable to MF08 for the monies received on various theories, including without limitation based upon the contention that the transfers may have constituted fraudulent transfers.\n2.03 During the time period from December of 2007 through approximately August of 2008, [REL] received cash and deposited that cash into its general account from multiple sources, including without limitation (a) the transfers from MF08 described in 2.01, above, (b) payoffs by [REL’s] borrowers of principal and interest, (c) sales of assets, and (d) advances by Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC (‘Wells Fargo”).\n2.04 During the time period from December of 2007 through approximately August of 2008, [REL] made payments out of its general account to many different parties, including without limitation, payments to various creditors, including without limitation the holders of Exchange Notes issued to [REL’s] Note-holders (the “REL Transfers”).\n2.05 MF08 contends that if it could trace the funds that it transferred to [REL] as described in Paragraph 2.01 from [REL] to the holders of Exchange Notes, MF08 might have the right to pursue recovery from the holders of Exchange Notes as “subsequent transferees” pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 550(d) [sic], [REL] contends that holders of Exchange Notes who received the REL Transfers cannot be liable to MF08 because (a) it is not possible to trace the dollars received from MF08 to any specific REL Transfer; and (b) each holder of an Exchange Note that received an REL Transfer, with the possible exception of insiders who may have received an REL Transfer, received any such REL Transfer on account of a debt payable by [REL] for value, in good faith, and without knowledge of the void-ability of the transfer from MF08 to [REL] (even assuming the transfer is avoidable) and, therefore, would be shielded from liability pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 550(b).\n2.06 MF08’s potential right to assert claims against holders of Exchange Notes that received REL Transfers shall be referred to herein as “MF08’s Potential Avoidance Actions”.\nSections 3.01—3.03 dealt with the allowance of MF08’s claim in the REL case. In short, if REL’s Plan was confirmed and the plan compromise was' approved, MF08’s Proof of Claim “shall be allowed” in the amount of $66,226,496. Sections 4.01 — 4.02 dealt with waiver of the right to pursue MF08 Potential Avoidance Actions:\n4.01 If the MF08 Claim is Allowed pursuant to Paragraph 3 above,’ MF08 waives the right to pursue any MF08 Potential Avoidance Actions; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not limit or restrict the right of MF08 to bring any action against any third party, including any manager, member, insider or professional of MF08. This provision shall be void and of no further force or effect if the MF08 Claim is not Allowed pursuant to Paragraph 3, above.\n4.02 With respect to the claims released herein, MF08 acknowledges that it has been advised by its attorneys concerning, and is familiar with, the California Civil Code Section 1542 and it expressly waives any and all rights under California Civil Code Section 1542 and under any other federal or state statute or law of similar effect with respect to the claims released herein. Section 1542 of the California Civil Code provides as follows:\nA GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.\nDocket no. 48, RJN Ex. 9-10 (Motion and Settlement Agreement) (emphasis in original).\nF. The Transfer to Montgomery\nThe Trustee declares that shortly after she was appointed as Trustee in February 2012, she was provided all the books and records maintained by MF08, including the bank statements and general ledgers for both MF08 and TMF. Docket no. 44-5, Uecker Dec. ¶ 3.\nBetween approximately July 22, 2008 and October 8, 2008, the managers of REL made a series of transfers from MF08 to TMF and these funds were used to pay REL investors to keep the REL “Ponzi scheme” going. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 16-17. The transfer to Montgomery is allegedly one of these transfers. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 18. The FAC alleges that MF08 was insolvent at the time these transfers were made and they were made with actual or constructively fraudulent intent and no value was given in exchange. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 17-21. (The Trustee’s expert also states that MF08 was insolvent from its inception onwards. Docket no. 44-7, Sugarman Dec. ¶ 11. Montgomery .does not dispute that MF08 was insolvent.)\nMontgomery had $924,887 invested in REL as of December 31, 2007. Docket no. 46-2, Montgomery Dec. ¶ 4, Ex. 1, Ex. 5. On July 1, 2008, at Montgomery’s request, REL transferred $150,000 to Montgomery. On July 31, 2008, an additional- $150,000 was transferred to Montgomery. These transfers went directly to Montgomery’s Individual Retirement Account at Wells Fargo Bank. Docket no. 31, Answer Ex. B (9/30/08 REL investor portfolio account statement—each $150,000 transfer described as “sold shares” in REL); Docket no. 46-2, Montgomery Dec. Ex. 1 (3/18/10 REL investor portfolio account statement—each transfer described as “note prepay”); Docket no. 46-2, Montgomery Dec. Ex. 3.(1/1/08-12/31/08 Wells Fargo Bank IRA statement — each transfer described as “liquidation RE Loans”). The Trustee seeks to recover this second $150,000 transfer because it was made by a check written on TMF’s bank account.\nIn support of her motion, the Trustee offers the July 2008 bank statements for MF08 and TMF. Docket no. 44-5, Uecker Dec. Ex. 1-2. In support of his motion and in opposition to the Trustee’s, Montgomery offers REL’s -July 2008 bank statement. Docket no. 48, RJN, Ex. 12.\nThe bank documents offered by both the Trustee and Montgomery show the following sequence of events:\n1. On July 21, 2008, REL transferred $528,791 to MF08. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 12 at 2 of 6 (REL bank statement); Docket no. 44-6, Uecker Dec. Ex. 1 at 1 of 3 (MF08 bank statement).\n2. On July 21, 2008, MF08 transferred $528,791 to TMF. Docket no. 44-6, Uecker Dec. Ex. 1 at 2 of 3 (MF08 bank statement), Ex. 2 at 1 of 2 (TMF bank statement).\n3. On July 23, 2008, TMF wrote check no. 1020 for $150,000 made payable to ‘WFB IRA Services fbo Montgomery.” Docket no. 44-6, Uecker Dec. Ex. 3 ($150,-000 check).\n4. On July 25, 2008, REL transferred $447,566 to MF08. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 12 at 5 of 6 (REL bank statement), Docket no. 44-6, Uecker Dec. Ex. 1 at 2 of 3 (MF08 bank statement).\n5. On July 28, 2008, MF08 transferred $447,566 to TMF. Docket no. 44-6, Uecker Dec. Ex. 1 at 2 of 3 (MF08 bank statement) Ex. 2 at 1 of 2 (TMF bank statement).\n6. On July 28, 2008, TMF’s bank honored the $150,000 check to Montgomery. Docket no. 44-6, Uecker Dec. Ex. 2 at 2 of 2 (TMF bank statement). Montgomery’s IRA statement shows it had received this $150,000 as of July 31, 2008. Docket no. 46-2, Montgomery Dec. Ex. 3.\nThe Trustee points out that the only deposit into the TMF account between July 1 and July 23, 2008 was the $528,791 deposit and it raised the balance in this account to $571,022. However, the July 2008 TMF bank statement also shows that $447,566 was deposited on July 28, 2008. The TMF bank statement also shows there were only two withdrawals from the TMF account between July 21 and July 28 — the $150,000 check to Montgomery and a $400,000 wire transfer to another REL Noteholder who has settled his fraudulent transfer case brought by the Trustee.\nThe Trustee says MF08’s books and records do not show that MF08’s transfer 'of $528,791 to TMF was in payment of a debt owed by MF08 to TMF and do not show that MF08 received anything from TMF in exchange for this transfer. She also states that TMF’s records do not reflect that the transfer was in payment of a debt owed by MF08 to TMF or that TMF transferred any assets or property to MF08 in exchange for the funds. Docket no. 44-5, Uecker Dec. ¶ 9. Montgomery does not challenge this.\nIt is undisputed that in July 2008, REL transferred $528,791 to MF08 and then transferred $447,566 to MF08 and MF08 immediately transferred these exact amounts to TMF. It is also undisputed that when sufficient funds were in the TMF account, TMF’s bank honored the check to Montgomery and it was credited to his IRA on July 31, 2008.\nThe Trustee states that the $66 million in the Proof of Claim does not include the amounts that MF08 transferred to TMF which were then used to pay REL Note-holders such as Montgomery. Docket no. 44-5, Uecker Dec. ¶ 13-14. The only support for this assertion is the Trustee’s own statement. The time period for the Cash Transfers includes the date of the transfer to Montgomery. At a minimum, and without more support, this suggests that some of the funds transferred from MF08 to REL may eventually have made their way to him and this $150,000 transfer may be included in the total in the Proof of Claim.\nIII. Discussion\nA. Summary Judgment Standard\nA court should grant summary judgment if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), applicable here by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7056. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Material facts are those that may affect the outcome of the case. Anderson, at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505. A dispute about a material fact is genuine if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the non-moving party. Id. at 248-49, 106 S.Ct. 2505.\nA party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for the motion and identifying those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions or affidavits that demonstrate the absence of a triable issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). To meet its burden, the moving party must either produce evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving party’s claim or defense or show that the nonmoving party does not have enough evidence of an essential element to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial. Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. Ltd. v. Fritz Companies, Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir.2000).\nIf the moving party meets its initial burden, the burden shifts to the non-moving party, which must go beyond the pleadings and submit admissible evidence supporting its claims or defenses and showing a genuine issue for trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548; Nissan Fire, 210 F.3d at 1103. If the non-moving party does not produce evidence to show a genuine issue of material fact, the moving party is entitled to summary judgment. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548.\nIn ruling on a motion for summary judgment, inferences drawn from the underlying facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986).\nMontgomery has the burden of proving he is entitled to summary judgment on his affirmative defenses regarding the Settlement Agreement. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A court may grant summary judgment regarding the interpretation of ambiguous language in a contract if the non-moving party fails to point to any relevant extrinsic evidence supporting that party’s interpretation of the language. Compagnie Financiere de CIC et de L’Union Europeenne v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 232 F.3d 153 (2nd Cir.2000).\nThe Trustee has the burden of proof on the elements of her fraudulent transfer claim. To avoid summary judgment in her favor, Montgomery must identify specific triable facts. Southern California Gas Co. v. City of Santa Ana, 336 F.3d 885 (9th Cir.2003).\nB. The Trustee’s Summary Judgment Argument\nThe Trustee argues that she has shown that MF08 is entitled to summary judgment on its Civil Code § 3439.04(a)(2)(A) constructive fraudulent transfer claim (applicable here pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 544(b)).\nShe asserts that the undisputed facts show MF08 is entitled to avoid the transfer of $528,791 from MF08 to TMF and may recover $150,000 of it from Montgomery as either the initial transferee or the immediate transferee of the initial transferee as Bankruptcy Code § 550(a) permits. Docket no. 44, Memorandum at 10-11. She acknowledges that TMF may not have had dominion over the funds because TMF, MF08, and REL were all controlled by Walter and Kelly Ng which would make Montgomery the initial transferee rather than a subsequent transferee. However, she claims this does not change the outcome.\nThe Trustee also argues that she has shown she is entitled to summary judgment disposing of Montgomery’s affirmative defense under Bankruptcy Code § 550(b) because there is no evidence that he gave value to TMF or MF08 and his interpretation of the Settlement Agreement is simply incorrect. Docket no. 44, Memorandum at 12-17.\nIn opposition to the Trustee’s motion, Montgomery argues that he is, in fact, the recipient of a REL Transfer based on the series of transfers that ended with the TMF check to his IRA. Under that theory, he argues that the Settlement Agreement covers this transfer to him. He also contends that MF08’s waiver of the protections of Civil Code § 1542 in the Settlement Agreement also protects him. Relying on In re California Litjunding, 360 B.R. 310 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.2007), Montgomery also contends that the Trustee’s lawsuit is an impermissible collateral attack on the REL Confirmation Order. Docket no. 54, Memorandum.\nIn reply, the Trustee argues that Montgomery has not offered any evidence to defeat entry of summary judgment on her fraudulent transfer case. He has presented no evidence showing that MF08 did not have dominion over the funds that may have been transferred to it by REL. Whether REL was the source of the funds does not matter because there is no evidence that MF08’s right to use the funds was restricted in any way. Adams v. Anderson (In re Superior Stamp & Coin Co.), 223 F.3d 1004, 1009 (9th Cir.2000) (discussing earmarking doctrine for preference analysis, where bank advanced funds to debtor on condition they be used for paying a specific creditor, debtor did not have control over the funds, earmarking defense applied). As to the release issue, she argues that Montgomery ignores the plain language of the Settlement Agreement and offers no evidence on which the trier of fact could find that the Settlement Agreement was intended to release this claim. Docket no. 60, Reply Memorandum.\nC.Montgomery’s Summary Judgment Argument\nMontgomery moves for summary judgment on his affirmative defenses. He makes the same arguments made in opposition to the Trustee’s motion, i.e., that the Settlement Agreement covers this claim against him, that he is a good faith transferee for value, and that the evidence shows he was in fact the recipient of a REL Transfer. Docket no. 49, Memorandum.\nIn opposition to Montgomery’s motion, the Trustee argues Montgomery has offered no evidence to defeat her entitlement to summary judgment on her fraudulent transfer case and repeats the arguments about the interpretation of the Settlement Agreement. Docket' no. 52, Opposition Memorandum.\nIn reply, Montgomery argues it defies credulity for the Trustee to argue she was unaware of the transfers from MF08 to TMF because she had all relevant records at the time she signed the Settlement Agreement. The waiver of the protections of Civil Code § 1542 prevent her from suing him. Docket no. 61, Reply Memorandum.\nD.Discussion of the Release Issues\nThe essential question raised by Montgomery’s motion for summary judgment on his affirmative defense regarding the Settlement Agreement is whether the Settlement Agreement between REL and MF08 released this fraudulent transfer claim against him. Was he released as a subsequent transferee because he was paid by REL using untraceable MF08 money, or was he excluded from this released class because he was paid by TMF, MF08’s owner and manager, with funds traceable to, or originating with and under the dominion of, MF08? Was Montgomery released because MF08 waived the right to pursue unknown or unsuspected claims that it had at the time the Settlement Agreement was signed? Or is he a third party the Trustee reserved the right to sue?\nThe Trustee argues that the Settlement Agreement released only a narrow class of claims'—claims against REL Noteholders who were paid by REL—and § 4.01 preserves MF08’s right to bring this action against Montgomery as “any third party.” The Trustee also insists that the language of the Settlement Agreement does not support a finding that the intent of the parties was to release unknown claims. Docket no. 44, Trustee’s Memorandum at 17. On the other hand, Montgomery argues that the language of the Settlement Agreement clearly supports his position that the intent was to release this action against him. He relies on the language in the Settlement Agreement, and on the communications he received from the Noteholders Committee urging a vote in favor of the REL Plan. Docket no. 54, Montgomery’s Memorandum at 9; Docket no. 46-2, Montgomery Dec. Ex. 8 (Committee’s letter explaining REL Plan). Thus, they clearly disagree as to the Settlement Agreement’s meaning, suggesting, at the very least, that it may be ambiguous.\n1. Is the Settlement Agreement Ambiguous?\nIf the Settlement Agreement is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous. Winet v. Price, 4 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1165-66, 6 Cal. Rptr.2d 554 (1992). To determine whether it is ambiguous, the court provisionally accepts extrinsic evidence regarding competing interpretations of the Agreement. Pacific Gas & E. Co. v. G.W. Thomas Drayage & etc. Co., 69 Cal.2d 33, 39-40, 69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641 (1968) (rational interpretation requires at least a preliminary consideration of all credible evidence offered to prove the intention of the parties).\nMontgomery requests that the court take judicial notice of certain documents that are, in context, extrinsic evidence. As explained in Winet v. Price ;\nThe decision to admit' parol evidence involves a two-step process. First, the court provisionally receives (without actually admitting) all credible evidence concerning the .parties’ intentions to determine “ambiguity,” i.e., whether the language is “reasonably susceptible” to the interpretation urged by.a party.' If in light of the.extrinsic evidence the court decides the language is “reasonably susceptible” to the interpretation urged, the extrinsic evidence is then admitted to aid in the second step-interpreting the contract.\nWinet v. Price, 4 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1166, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554 (1992).\nThis threshold question regarding' ambiguity is answered in the affirmative by a review of the language of the Settlement Agreement, a review of the extrinsic evidence offered by Montgomery, and the language of the Proof of Claim itself.\nReferring to the defined terms in § 2.01-2.05 of the Settlement Agreement, the Trustee argues that MF08 released only its claims against REL Noteholders for recovery of amounts paid by REL and these are the MF08 Potential Avoidance Actions MF08 agreed to release. The Trustee also contends that the language in § 4.01 reserving the right to pursue “any action against any third party, including any manager, member, insider or professional of MF08” means that she may pursue Montgomery as he is “any third party.” She claims no extrinsic evidence is required to see the intent of the parties and none has been provided by Montgomery contradicting her interpretation.\nReferring to the undisputed fact that individuals Walter and Kelly Ng owned, controlled and managed REL, MF08 and TMF, Montgomery argues that the paid by REL terminology is a meaningless distinction in the context in which this settlement was reached and the release was intended to cover this transfer to him. He offers in support: (1) his REL investor portfolio account statement in which REL takes credit for the $150,000 payment TMF ostensibly made to him; (2) the REL Noteholders’ Committee’s letter to the REL Noteholders; (3) the findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of the REL Confirmation Order; and (4) his Wells Fargo Bank IRA statement indicating payments had come from REL. In addition, the court notes that language in MF08’s Proof of Claim shows that MF08 was aware that TMF was used to make the allegedly fraudulent transfers at the behest of the Ngs who controlled all of the related entities. Docket no. 44-5, Uecker Dec., Ex. 5, (Proof of Claim ¶ 3 (the “Ngs caused the transfer” of $66 million, the transfers were made “either directly to REL, indirectly through TMF or Bar-K, or [directly] to REL’s borrowers”)).\nThe court has provisionally admitted this evidence and reviewed it. The court concludes that the language of the Settlement Agreement is reasonably susceptible to the competing interpretations offered by the parties and it is therefore ambiguous.\n2. The Extrinsic Evidence\nHaving found that the Settlement Agreement is ambiguous, the court can admit all credible extrinsic evidence to construe it. Pacific Gas & E. Co. v. G.W. Thomas Drayage etc. Co., 69 Cal.2d 33, 37, 69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641 (1968). Such evidence includes the circumstances surrounding the making of the Agreement, including its object, nature, and subject matter. The court takes judicial notice of the extrinsic evidence requested by Montgomery.\nIf the extrinsic evidence is not in conflict, the resolution of the ambiguity is a question of law. Wolf v. Superior Court, 114 Cal.App.4th 1343, 1351, 8 Cal.Rptr.3d 649 (2004); Scheenstra v. California Dairies, Inc., 213 Cal.App.4th 370, 390, 153 Cal.Rptr.3d 21 (2013) (even where uncontroverted evidence allows for conflicting inferences to be drawn, interpretation of contract solely a judicial function). Here, the extrinsic evidence is not in conflict.\n3. Interpretation of the Settlement Agreement\nSection 8.07 of the Settlement Agreement provides that it is to be governed by California law. Under California law, the court interprets the Settlement Agreement using the same principles applicable to the interpretation of any other contract. The goal is to interpret it to give effect to the mutual intent of the parties as it existed when they contracted. Civil Code § 1636 (contract must be interpreted to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting, so far as the same is ascertainable and lawful), Pacific Gas & E. Co., 69 Cal.2d at 38, 69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641. It is the outward expression of the agreement, rather than a party’s unexpressed intention, which the court will enforce. Winet, 4 Cal.App.4th at 1165, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554.\nA release is the abandonment, relinquishment or giving up of a right or claim to the person against whom it might have been demanded or enforced. Civil Code § 1541 (an obligation is extinguished by a release therefrom given to the debtor by the creditor); Marder v. Lopez, 450 F.3d 445 (9th Cir.2006). In general, a written release extinguishes any obligation covered by the release’s terms, provided it has not been obtained by fraud, deception, misrepresentation, duress, or undue influence. Marder, 450 F.3d at 449.\n4. “REL Transfer” and “Paid by REL”\nThe Trustee argues that the Settlement Agreement defines a narrow category of claims in §§ 2.04-2.06 which were released: the MF08 Potential Avoidance Actions against REL Noteholders who were paid by REL with the $66 million transferred from MF08. It is undisputed that the check Montgomery received was written by TMF from its bank account. Based on this fact alone, the Trustee claims Montgomery was not paid by REL so he is not among the class of REL Noteholders covered by the release in the Settlement Agreement.\nMontgomery’s interpretation of “REL Transfer” and “paid by REL”. in the Settlement Agreement relies, in part, on his extrinsic evidence regarding the context in which the Settlement Agreement was reached.\nThe extrinsic evidence is consistent on one essential point. By everything he was told by REL, it is reasonable to interpret the Settlement Agreement as Montgomery does. By all appearances, he had been paid by REL and had received a REL Transfer: (1) he was paid in the time period described in the Proof of Claim (i.e., December 2007-February 2009), and in the time period in § 2.04 of the Settlement Agreement (i.e., December 2007-August 2008); and (2) his investor portfolio account statement showed REL took credit for making the $150,000 payment when it was made.\nThe REL Noteholders’ Committee’s communications to Montgomery and the other REL Noteholders were consistent with the documentation Montgomery had received from REL before any controversy arose. REL Docket no. 832 (Notehold-ers’ Committee’s proposed solicitation let- • ter); Docket no. 46-2, Montgomery Dec. Ex. 8 (final version of solicitation letter: “In addition, MF08 will release any claims it could otherwise assert against Notehold-ers that received transfers from REL (other than insiders)”).\nFinally, it is undisputed that the Ngs controlled MF08, TMF, and REL and had a pattern of treating them as they wished as the MF08 Proof of Claim stated — the Ngs caused the $66 million in transfers to be made, either directly or indirectly. Based on this, the court concludes that Montgomery’s interpretation of the phrases “REL Transfer” and “paid by REL” is reasonable and the Trustee’s is erroneous.\n5. “Any Third Party”\nUnder § 4.01 of the Settlement Agreement, MF08 waived the right to pursue any MF08 Potential Avoidance Actions “provided, however, that this agreement shall not limit or restrict the right of MF08 to bring any action against any third party, including any manager, member, insider or professional of MF08.” The Trustee argues that this savings clause in § 4.01 preserves all claims other than those against REL Noteholders who were “paid by REL.”\nFor several reasons, the Trustee’s interpretation of this savings clause is erroneous. First, read literally, the reservation of the right to pursue “any third party” would arguably mean no one was released. That absurd reading is to be avoided. Civil Code § 1688.\nSecond, the undisputed objective of the Settlement Agreement was (1) to resolve the issues regarding the validity and priority of MF08’s claim which was based on the alleged fraudulent transfer of $66 million to REL where tracing was problematic and the Ngs’ commingling was endemic; (2) to eliminate the REL Noteholders’ risk of being sued by both MF08 and REL as the alleged recipients of fraudulent transfers in order to ensure their support for REL’s Plan; and (3) to eliminate MF08’s ability to impede confirmation because MF08’s $66 million claim made it the largest unsecured creditor in REL’s case.\nBased on the context in which the Settlement Agreement arose, the court declines to adopt the Trustee’s interpretation that an avoidance action against “any third party” includes a REL Noteholder who was paid by MF08 or TMF. If there was an intent to carve this group of REL Note-holders out of the release, it had to be precisely stated before the settlement was incorporated into REL’s Plan. MF08 acknowledged from the start that the “Ngs caused” every payment by any of these affiliated entities to be made in a way that suited their designs and the record shows the Trustee was in possession of records that would have enabled her to trace this transfer before she signed the Settlement Agreement. To pretend otherwise endorses a fiction — that MF08 had legitimate independent management.\nThe settlement between REL and MF08, with the full participation of the REL Noteholders’ Committee, was negotiated in order to “buy peace” with all the stakeholders so REL could reach a consensual confirmation of its Plan. As it was described in the Motion, “the principal parties in interest in the Debtors’ chapter 11 cases have reached the Agreement which resolves both potential disputes regarding MF08’s proof of claim ... and the relative treatment of all unsecured claims and Noteholder claims under the Modified Plan.” Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶ 8) (emphasis added). The Trustee obtained the $5 million “enhancement” and the REL Noteholders agreed to reduce their claims by 50% of what they had been paid on their REL investments pre-petition. The REL Noteholders were led to believe their risk of being sued — by MF08 and REL — as the recipients of allegedly fraudulent transfers was eliminated.\nIn addition, the drafting of § 4.01 is troubling. The words “include” and “including” are not limiting. Because “including” does not place a limit on “any third party” why follow “any third party” with the narrow list of “any manager, member, insider, or professional of MF08”? See In re Coudert Bros., 487 B.R. 375, 390 (S.D.N.Y.2013) (interpreting employment agreement, “may include” by itself is not a limiting clause but it does not exist in isolation; the following phrasfe “and whatever other action ...” is one of limitation).\nThere are several contract interpretation tools that support finding that the Trustee’s interpretation of “any third party” is erroneous. For example, under the principle ejusdem generis (literally, of the same kind), where specific words follow general words in a contract, the general words are construed to embrace only things similar in nature to those enumerated by the specific words. California Farm Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd., 143 Cal. App.4th 173, 189, 49 Cal.Rptr.3d 169 (2006) (where specific words follow general words, the general words are construed to embrace only things similar to the enumerated specific words), Nygard, Inc. v. Uusi-Kerttula, 159 Cal.App.4th 1027, 1045, 72 Cal.Rptr.3d 210 (2008) (“any information” construed in light of the kinds of protected information enumerated in the next sentence). Applying that principle here indicates that the specific class — managers, members, insiders or professionals of MF08 — defines the broad class — third parties. REL Noteholders are not in the class of intended third parties.\nThe rule of interpretation noscitur a sociis (literally, it is known from its associates) suggests that where “any third party” is ambiguous, its meaning may be discerned from the list that follows it, i.e., here it means only third parties who were managers, members, insiders or professionals of MF08. California Farm Bureau Federation, at 189, 49 Cal.Rptr.3d 169.\nThe rule of interpretation ex-pressio unius est exclusio alterius means the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of the other. Rosenthal-Zuckerman v. Epstein, Becker & Green Long Term Disability Plan, 39 F.Supp.3d 1103, 1107 (C.D.Cal.2014). Application of this concept suggests that the list following “any third party” illustrates the type of third party — managers, members, insiders or professionals of MF08. REL Notehold-ers are not within this type of third party.\nThese interpretive rules assist the court in discerning the meaning of “any action against any third party” in § 4.01. Based on these rules and the context for the settlement, the court concludes that the Trustee’s interpretation of the phrase “any action against any third party, including any manager, member, insider or professional of MF08” is incorrect. As a REL Noteholder, Montgomery is not the type of third party the Trustee may sue.\n6. Waiver of the Right to Pursue Unknown Claims\nCivil Code § 1542 provides that a general release does not extend to claims that are unknown or unsuspected at the time the release is executed. Because MF08 waived the protection of Civil Code § 1542, the release in the Settlement Agreement does apply to claims that were unknown or unsuspected at the time she signed the Settlement Agreement.\nThe Trustee argues that MF08 waived the protections of Civil Code § 1542 only “with respect to the claims released herein” and the “claims released herein” are only the claims against REL Noteholders who were paid by REL. As discussed above, the court finds that this distinction between “paid by REL” and “paid by TMF” does not hold up.\nBut the Trustee’s argument regarding Civil Code § 1542 bears further discussion. The Trustee says she possessed all the relevant books and records, but at the time she signed the Settlement Agreement, she was “not aware that funds had been transferred from MF08 to TMF and then used to pay REL Noteholders” because she and her counsel were “focused on maximizing the value of MF08’s claim and on the preservation and liquidation of MF08’s loan portfolio.” Docket no. 54-5, Uecker Dec. ¶ 8, ¶ 16-17. This is troubling in itself as it was her duty to be fully informed during the settlement negotiations and she possessed the records that allowed her to be fully informed. If she was aware of these transfers but did not disclose them, it gives the appearance that she may not have been fully candid with the other participants in the mediation. At a minimum, prudence would suggest that the waiver of the protections of Civil Code § 1542 should have been more carefully considered than it seems to have been, more carefully drafted than it was, or omitted altogether.\nThe Trustee concedes that there is what she calls a “boilerplate” waiver of Civil Code § 1542’s protections but contends the § 1542 waiver does not operate to release this claim because “there is no language in the release purporting to release unknown claims and Montgomery did not introduce any evidence that the parties’ intent was to release unknown claims,” and there is “no language in the REL Settlement Agreement releasing claims that the Trustee did not know or suspect to exist” or language by which “the parties took the risk that unknown or unanticipated claims might exist.” Docket no. 52, Opposition Memorandum at 7. She insists that what she calls the “mere recital” of the § 1542 waiver is not sufficient.\nThe Trustee is wrong for several reasons. First, the language in the Settlement Agreement is more than a “mere recital” of a Civil Code § 1542 waiver. The Settlement Agreement clearly acknowledges that (1) her counsel had given her advice about the significance of waiving § 1542, and (2) she was independently aware of the significance of waiving its protections for both unknown or unsuspected claims.\nSecond, in every place she makes this argument about the necessity of “independent language,” the Trustee quotes one isolated sentence from Casey v. Proctor, 59 Cal.2d 97, 109, 28 Cal.Rptr. 307, 378 P.2d 579 (1963):\nIt therefore appears beyond reasonable doubt that Civil Code section 1542 was intended by its drafters to preclude the application of a release to unknown claims in the absence of a showing apart from the words of the release of an intent to include such claims.\nId. at 109, 28 Cal.Rptr. 307, 378 P.2d 579.\nIn Casey, plaintiff was involved in a car accident and quickly afterwards signed a release covering property damage (for which he was paid) and bodily injuries (for which he was not paid); the release did not include a waiver of Civil Code § 1542. When plaintiff later began to suffer-injuries stemming from the accident, he sued to recover compensation for these injuries. Defendant moved for and was given a directed verdict based on the release. The directed verdict was reversed on appeal. When the release was signed, neither party had reason to believe personal injuries had been suffered. Plaintiff argued that the release was a general release which, by operation of § 1542, did not extend to these unknown injuries. Defendant argued that it was a specific, not a general release, because it referred to unknown claims so plaintiff had released the personal injury claim. The court explained that § 1542 was not intended to prevent settlements of unknown claims:\nIts purpose was to prevent the mere recital in the release to that effect from barring a claim for injuries later discovered in the absence of a showing of a conscious understanding that if injuries were suffered which had not yet manifested themselves they too would be discharged by the release.\nId. at 109, 28 Cal.Rptr. 307, 378 P.2d 579.\nCasey is not helpful to the Trustee for several reasons. First, it is a personal injury case, a context with its own set of policy concerns lacking here. Brae Transp. Inc. v. Coopers & Lybrand, 790 F.2d 1439, 1445 (9th Cir.1986) (declining to apply rationale of personal injury cases to commercial case). Second, as explained in Winet v. Price, 4 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1171, n.7, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554 (1992):\nTo the extent Casey holds we must ignore the language of the release and examine only extrinsic evidence in evaluating the parties intent, Casey would be inconsistent with the Pacific Gas & E. Co. admonition that the contractual language is the source of the parties’ rights and duties, and that extrinsic evidence is examined only to construe any ambiguities extant in the language.\nId. at 1174, n. 7, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554.\nThird, the Settlement Agreement does indicate a conscious understanding that there may be other claims. The settlement was in significant part predicated on the difficulty and expense of tracing the transfers made by the Ng family members by and among their wholly owned entities. The presence of this tracing issue itself indicates a conscious understanding— apart from the words of the release in § 4.01 — that there was a risk that unknown or unsuspected claims might exist.\nFinally, the Trustee- argues that the § 1542 waiver is limited to “the claims released herein” — by which she means the REL Transfers and the MF08 Potential Avoidance Actions but nothing else. She is correct that a § 1542 waiver may be limited to specific- claims or circumstances. See Butler v. Vons Companies, Inc., 140 Cal.App.4th 943, 45 Cal.Rptr.3d 151 (2006) (contract ambiguous as to whether employee only released labor grievance claims and not employment discrimination claims so that § 1542 waiver may not apply to discrimination claim); Asare v. Hartford Fire Inc. Co., 1 Cal.App.4th 856, 2 Cal. Rptr.2d 452 (1991) (release of workers compensation claim did not apply to discrimination claim); Integrated Global Concepts, Inc. v. J2 Global, Inc., 2014 WL 1230910 (N.D.Cal. March 21, 2014) (waiver of § 1542 was limited by language to specific claims predating the agreement).\nThe weakness in this argument is that the claim against Montgomery is the same type of avoidance claim that the Trustee released — the only difference is that his IRA received $150,000 from a bank account in the name of TMF, MF08’s only member and manager. Unlike the distinction in Butler, where the question was about a labor grievance claim and an employment discrimination claim, or the issue in Asare, where the question was about a workers compensation claim and an employment discrimination claim, the distinction between an an avoidance action against an REL Noteholder “paid by REL” and one “paid by TMF,” ostensibly acting on behalf of REL, is too thin to hold up. See Brae Transportation, Inc. v. Coopers & Lybrand, 790 F.2d 1439 (9th Cir. 1986) (release covered claims regarding net worth, release was general as to this “type of claim”).\nMost problematic for the Trustee is her misplaced reliance on Winet v. Price, 4 Cal.App.4th 1159, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554 (1992). In Winet, an attorney and his former client entered into an agreement releasing all claims against the attorney including unknown and unsuspected claims, and waiving the benefit of Civil Code § 1542. Years later the client sued the attorney. The trial court granted summary judgment for the attorney on the theory that the release covered all claims being asserted by the former client.\nThe appellate court agreed. First, the unambiguous language of the agreement released all claims, known or unknown. Second, the client’s proffered testimony— his uncommunicated subjective intent that he did not intend to release a later discovered claim — was parol evidence that was inadmissible because it contradicted the agreement and the agreement was not reasonably susceptible to the client’s interpretation. Third, the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the release suggested that the client did in fact intend to release unknown claims.\nThe court explained that the client’s evidence of his subjective intent was not admissible because it:\nseeks to prove that a release of unknown or unsuspected claims was not intended to include unknown or unsuspected claims. If an argument such as this were given currency, a release could never effectively encompass unknown claims. A releasor would simply argue that a release of unknown or unsuspected claims applied only to known or suspected claims, making it ineffective as to unknown or unsuspected claims.\nId. at 1167, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554 (emphasis in original).\nThis is precisely the problem with the Trustee’s argument regarding MF08’s waiver of the protections of Civil Code § 1542. She admits she possessed all the MF08 and TMF bank records at the time she negotiated the Settlement Agreement and then declares she was not aware of the transfer that went from MF08 to TMF to Montgomery. In effect, she says that she did not intend to waive this unknown or unsuspected claim because she did not know of it or suspect she had it. Because she apparently belatedly discovered that she could trace funds from MF08 to TMF to Montgomery, she claims she can escape the fact that she waived the right to pursue unknown claims. In the context of this case, especially where the inability to trace was one of the underlying predicates for the Settlement Agreement, she cannot escape the conclusion that MF08’s waiver the protection of Civil Code § 1542 prevents her from pursuing recovery from Montgomery.\nIV. Conclusion\nFor the reasons explained above, the court grants summary adjudication in favor of Montgomery. The Settlement Agreement is ambiguous and the extrinsic evidence shows that the release in the Settlement Agreement covers the Trustee’s claims in this adversary proceeding. The remaining issues are moot.\n. The REL Disclosure Statement explains that REL was the successor entity resulting from the merger of nine limited partnerships into a limited liability company. B-4 Partners was REL’s sole manager from 2002 to REL’s ch. 11 filing in 2011 and REL's sole member from November 2007. From 2009, Walter, Kelly, and Barney Ng were the members of B-4 Partners. Walter Ng was a manager of B-4 Partners until he resigned when his bankruptcy case was filed in May 2011. REL Docket no. 843, Disclosure Statement at 18.\n. The REL plan confirmation process was underway in April 2012; the first version of its plan and disclosure statement were filed February 1, 2012. REL Docket nos. 465-466.\n. The court notes that in the Proof of Claim, the time period for the transfer of $66 million is December 4, 2007 to February 4, 2009 — not August 2008. Also, § 2.01 of the Settlement Agreement says the $66 million was transferred from “December 2007 through 2008” and § 2.04 defines the REL Transfers as having been made \""between December 2007 through approximately August 2008.” The FAC says the time period for the transfer to Montgomery is July 22, 2008 to October 8, 2008. There is no explanation for these differing dates. It is unclear if there is any significance to these differences.\n. The REL Confirmation Order describes MF08 as REL’s largest unsecured creditor. REL Docket no. 967, REL Confirmation Order ¶ M.\n. According to the Trustee’s Third Quarter 2015 Operating Report, the MF08 estate has been paid $1,591 million by the REL estate as of April 2015. MF08 Docket no. 824 (Operating Report).\n. Upon MF08's filing in September 2011, the Ngs were removed and new management and their professionals \""thoroughly reviewed MF08’s books and records with a view to tracing all transfers of cash made by MF08 during the history of its existence.” MF08 Docket no. 101, Disclosure Statement at 5. The court assumes this analysis was shared with the Trustee upon her appointment in February 2012 and that she possessed this information at the time she participated in the mediation in April 2012.\n. In September 2013, the Trustee commenced 16 other adversary proceedings against REL Noteholders with the same basic allegations as made in this case. Eight of these are still pending.\n. There is no explanation for this varying terminology.\n. The Trustee has objected to the admission of the REL bank statement on the grounds it is hearsay. The Trustee is correct. However, the Trustee appears to waive this objection by responding that the payments shown on this bank statement are shown on MF08’s records as payments by REL of accrued interest to MF08. Docket no. 52-1, Uecker Dec. ¶ 7-8.\n. The Trustee contends that the transfers of $528,791 and $447,566 were for \""payment of accrued interest\"" on two loans sold by REL to MF08 in April 2008 but with the sales made effective as of December 2007. Docket no. 52-1, Uecker Dec., ¶ 6-9. However, according to the Trustee’s expert, \""[a]s of March 2008, the borrowers on these loans had stopped paying interest and the loans were in default.” Docket no. 44-7, Sugarman Dec., ¶ 9-10. The T & J Saucepan loan was in default at the time of transfer'to MF08; the Peachtree loan was delinquent 30 days as of June 30, 2008. Docket no. 44-10, Sugarman Report at 12-14. Thus, it is unclear if interest payments were in fact made by REL’s borrowers or if these payments were fictional.\n. At oral argument Trustee’s counsel stated there was a basis for the assertion but did not specify what it was.\n. She also argues she has shown she is entitled to summary judgment on a Civil Code § 3439.05 claim but there is no such claim pled in the FAC.\n. Civil Code § 3439.01(a)(asset means property of debtor) and (h) (property means anything that may be subject of ownership); Bankruptcy Code § 548(a)(1) (a trustee may avoid a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property); In re Bullion Reserve of North America, 922 F.2d 544, 548 (9th Cir.1991) (discussing requirement of dominion over money for transferee status); In re Incomnet, Inc., 463 F.3d 1064 (9th Cir.2006) (discussing definition of transferee).\n.Because her claim is based on Civil Code § 3439.04 and § 3439.07, the defenses under Civil Code § 3439.08 are also relevant. In re ITS Corporation (Decker v. Tramiel), 617 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir.2010).\n. The Trustee also objects to many of the so-called undisputed facts in Montgomery’s motion. Docket no. 52-3, Statement of Disputed Facts in Opposition. The Trustee is largely correct.\n. The Trustee argues that the court should ignore the REL Noteholders’ Committee’s letter because it is the uncommunicated subjective intent of the Committee which is irrelevant in this context. Docket no. 52, Opposition at 22. The letter, in substantially the same form, was approved by the REL court to be delivered to the REL Noteholders with the ballot for voting on the REL Plan. REL Docket no. 832 (proposed solicitation letter). It was obviously communicated to the REL Noteholders. The REL Noteholders’ Committee’s counsel’s task was to explain the consequences of voting for or against confirmation. It is of limited utility here and the court merely notes the inaccuracy of the Trustee’s characterization of it as “uncom-municated.”\n. The Trustee argues that Montgomery has no extrinsic evidence that the parties to the Settlement Agreement intended to release any REL Noteholder who was not \""paid by REL.” In any argument about the intent of the parties, Montgomery is at a distinct disadvantage. As a REL Noteholder, counsel to the REL Noteholders’ Committee represented him in the negotiations and he is an intended beneficiary of the settlement.\n. The Declaration of James A. Weissenborn in support of confirmation of the REL Plan is consistent with this interpretation. REL Docket no. 943, ¶ 39-53 (describing the settlements implemented by the REL Plan).\n. Montgomery appears to misunderstand the terms of this 50% reduction. As the Motion explained it, if the plan compromise was approved, the Noteholders’ claims \""would not be subordinated or challenged, but each Note-holder’s claim would be reduced by 50% of any cash received after the Exchange Transaction through the petition date” of REL. In theory, the allowed amount of Montgomery's claim was to be reduced by 50% of the $450,000 he appears to have been repaid.\n. See American Sur. Co. of N.Y. v. Marotta, 287 U.S. 513, 53 S.Ct. 260, 77 L.Ed. 466 (1933) (\""include” is generally used as a word of extension or enlargement rather than one of limitation or enumeration); Fraser v. Bentel, 161 Cal.390, 119 P. 509 (1911)(\""includes” is not ordinarily a word of limitation, but rather of enlargement); Bankruptcy Code § 102(3) (same).\n. A release may also be construed most strongly against the party who prepared it. Sime v. Malouf, 95 Cal.App.2d 82, 212 P.2d 946 (1949). There is nothing indicating which party prepared the Settlement Agreement. It may have been drafted by REL's counsel or by the Trustee’s counsel; counsel to the REL Noteholders Committee may have participated in the drafting.\n. She goes so far as to say there is a “Casey rule.” Docket no. 61, Reply Memorandum at 10. As discussed in Winet v. Price, the California Supreme Court's Pacific Gas & Electric decision shows Casey has questionable prece-dential value. Winet, 4 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1171 n. 7, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554 (1992). The notion that there is a “Casey rule” is a pointless embellishment that comes, very close to being a misleading suggestion regarding the current state of the law."",""type"":""majority""}],""judges"":[],""head_matter"":""IN RE: MORTGAGE FUND ’08 LLC, Debtor.

Introduction\nBefore the court are cross-motions for summary judgment by plaintiff Susan L. Uecker, the liquidating trustee appointed under the confirmed plan of Mortgage Fund ’08 LLC (the “Trustee” and “MF08”), and defendant Robert L. Montgomery. This matter has been fully briefed and argued.\nThe Trustee moves for summary judgment on the California Civil Code § 3439.04(a) constructive fraudulent transfer claim in her first amended complaint. Montgomery moves for summary judgment on the affirmative defenses asserted in his answer.\nFor the reasons explained below, the court grants summary adjudication for Montgomery on his affirmative defense regarding the effect of a release in a settlement agreement which effectively moots the remaining summary judgment issues.\nII. Background\nThese motions require a review of certain events in MF08’s chapter 11 case and the chapter 11 case of its affiliate, RE Loans, LLC, which was filed in the Northern District of Texas (Case no. 11-35865-BJH) (“REL”).\nThe following facts are taken from the First Amended Complaint (the “FAC”) (Docket no. 30); Montgomery’s Answer to the FAC (Docket no. 31); the Trustee’s Declaration and Statement of Undisputed Facts (Docket nos. 44-2 and 44-5); Montgomery’s Declaration and Statement of Undisputed Facts (Docket nos. 46-1 and 46-2); and Montgomery’s Request for Judicial Notice (Docket no. 48).\nFor context, the court also takes judicial notice of MF08’s Plan and Disclosure Statement (MF08 Docket nos. 101-102); REL’s Disclosure Statement (REL Docket no. 843); REL’s Plan (REL Docket no. 905); the Declaration of James A. Weis-senborn in Support of Confirmation of the REL Plan (REL Docket no. 943); and the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Confirming the REL Plan (the “REL Confirmation Order”) (REL Docket no. 967). Harris v. Cnty of Orange, 682 F.3d 1126, 1132 (9th Cir.2012) (court may take judicial notice of undisputed matters of public record including documents on file in federal courts).\nA. The Bankruptcy Cases\nMF08’s bankruptcy case was commenced as an involuntary chapter 7 on September 12, 2011. MF08 Docket no. 1. The case was converted to chapter 11 and an order for relief was entered on September 28, 2011. MF08 Docket no. 11. The order approving its Disclosure Statement and confirming its Plan was entered on February 3, 2012 and the Trustee has been in place since that time. MF08 Docket nos. 144-145.\nREL commenced its chapter 11 case in the Northern District of Texas on September 13, 2011. REL Docket no. 1. The REL Confirmation Order was entered on June 26, 2012. As will be explained below, MF08 filed a claim in the REL case which is the genesis for these motions.\nB. Ownership and Operation of MF08 and REL\nWalter Ng and his sons Kelly Ng and Barney Ng owned, managed, and controlled, directly or indirectly, MF08 and REL and their related entities, B-4 Partners, LLC and Bar-K. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 8-10; Docket no. 31, Answer ¶ 8-10; Docket no. 44-5, Uecker Deck Ex. 5 (MF08’s proof of claim filed in REL’s case (the “Proof of Claim”); REL Docket no. 843 (Disclosure Statement). The FAC alleges that Walter and Kelly Ng formed REL in January 2002. REL made secured loans to real estate developers.. To raise money to fund these loans, it sold unregistered securities to investors who became members of REL. By the end of 2006, REL had raised over $700 million, had over 1,400 members and reported more than $55 million cash on hand. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 12; Docket no. 31, Answer ¶ 12; Docket no. 44-10, Sugarman Report. See also, REL Disclosure Statement (REL Docket no. 843); Declaration of James A. Weissenborn in support of confirmation of REL Plan (REL Docket no. 943).\nIn early 2007, REL faced liquidity problems. \'It had been advised by its attorneys that it could not raise more money from new investors- which meant it would then be unable to meet the withdrawal demands of its old investors and meet its funding commitments to its borrowers. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 13-14; Docket no. 44-10, Sugar-man Report at 3-5.\nIn November 2007, REL made its members into noteholders in what is referred to as the “Exchange Transaction” and the issuance of “Exchange Notes.” REL Docket no. 843, Disclosure Statement at 21-22. When it filed its bankruptcy case in September 2011, REL had approximately 2,900 noteholders who were owed approximately $646 million (the “REL Noteholders”). REL Docket no. 843, Disclosure Statement at 22-23. Montgomery is an REL Noteholder,\nIn December 2007, the managers of REL created MF08. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 16; Docket no. 44-10, Sugarman Report at 1. The Mortgage Fund, LLC (“TMF”) was MF08’s sole member and manager; Walter Ng and Kelly Ng were the sole members of TMF and thus controlled MF08. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 8-10; Docket no. 31, Answer ¶ 8-10. REL, MF08, TMF, B-4 Partners, and Bar-K all did business from the same address in Lafayette, California. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 9; Docket no. 31, Answer ¶ 9.\nMF08’s stated purpose was to make secured loans to real estate developers. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 16; Docket no. 44-10, Sugarman Report at 1. MF08 did business much as REL did after the Exchange Transaction. As of its petition date, MF08 had approximately 572 noteholders who were owed approximately $80 million and held a real estate portfolio valued at approximately $72 million. MF08 Docket no. 101, Disclosure Statement at 1-8.\nC. MF08’s $66 Million Proof of Claim in the REL Case\nThe Trustee’s declaration states that “[p]rior to. my appointment as trustee, MF08 asserted that MF08 transferred $66,226,496 to REL and that REL was liable to MF08 in this amount. I continued to assert this claim after my appointment.” Docket no. 44-5, Uecker Dec. ¶ 13-14, Ex. 5 (Proof of Claim). The Proof of Claim describes the MF08 ownership structure as noted above. It asserts:\n[B]etween December 4, 2007, and February 4, 2009, the Ngs caused the aggregate sum of $66,226,496 to be transferred from MF08’s bank accounts to [REL] (the “Cash Transfers”). The Cash Transfers were made either (1) directly to [REL], (2) indirectly through [TMF] or Bar-K, or (3) to [REL’s] borrowers to enable such borrowers to service or repay loans extended to them by [REL].\nDocket no. 44-5, Uecker Dec. Ex. 5 (emphasis added).\nThe Proof of Claim seeks the recovery of the Cash Transfers based on the theory that MF08 made them with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud entities to whom MF08 was or became indebted. It includes a list of each of the Cash Transfers that totals $66,226,496.\nD. MF08 Settlement with REL and Confirmation of the REL Plan\nREL informally objected to MF08’s Proof of Claim. Docket no. 44-5, Uecker Dec. ¶ 14. In April 2012, the principal stakeholders in the \' REL case — REL, Wells Fargo Capital Finance (REL’s secured lender), and the official REL Noteholders’ Committee (representing Montgomery’s interests as a REL Note-holder) — participated in a judicial mediation. They then reached a settlement of the outstanding issues regarding the validity and priority of MF08’s Proof of Claim, along with related issues which allowed REL to proceed to confirmation of its Plan. Docket no. 44-5, Uecker Dec. ¶ 14-15.\nREL filed a motion to obtain court approval of the settlement. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion for Approval of Settlement, REL Docket no. 907 (the “Motion”). Attached to the Motion is an unsigned copy of the settlement agreement between REL and MF08 (the “Settlement Agreement”). Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 9 (Settlement Agreement), REL Docket no. 907-1 (Settlement Agreement).\nThe Motion describes the Proof of Claim and MF08’s fraudulent transfer theory. The Motion defines the “REL Transfers” as the transfer of $66 million made between December 2007 and “approximately August of 2008” and the commingling by REL in its general account with other REL funds. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶ 12-13). MF08 contended that “if it can trace the funds that it transferred to REL from REL to any given [REL] Noteholder, MF08 might have the right to pursue recovery from that [REL] Noteholder as a subsequent transferee pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 550(b).” These are defined as the “MF08 Potential Avoidance Actions.” Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶ 14). The Motion then describes the response by REL and the REL Noteholders Committee:\n[REL] and the Noteholders Committee contend that Noteholders who received the REL Transfers who were not insiders of [REL] cannot be liable to MF08 because (a) it is not possible to trace the dollars received from MF08 to any specific REL Transfer or transferee; and (b) each [REL] Noteholder that received an REL Transfer, with the possible exception of insiders of [REL], received any such REL Transfer on account of a debt payable by [REL] for value, in good faith, and without knowledge of the voidability of the transfer from MF08 to [REL] (even assuming that transfer is avoidable) and, therefore, would be shielded from liability pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 550(b).\nDocket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶ 15) (emphasis added).\nThe Motion then describes the “prior plan compromise” which had been negotiated by REL and the REL Noteholders’ Committee and the change to it which was now required by this proposed settlement with MF08. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶ 16). Essentially, the prior plan compromise provided that if the REL Noteholders voted to accept the plan, the REL Noteholders’ lien on REL assets would be released, they would share pro rata with holders of general unsecured claims and their claims would not be “subordinated or challenged,” but each REL Noteholder’s claim would be reduced by 50% of any cash received after the November 2007 Exchange Transaction through the REL petition date. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶ 16).\nThe proposed deal with MF08 made one change to the “prior plan compromise.” Instead of the REL Noteholders sharing pro rata with the general unsecured creditors, the first $5 million to be distributed was to go to general unsecured creditors before the REL Noteholders would share pro rata. This change increased the distribution to general unsecured creditors— primarily benefitting MF08 as the largest such creditor — and reduced the distribution to REL Noteholders through reallocation of the first $5 million. In exchange for this “enhancement,” MF08 agreed to vote its $66 million claim in favor of the plan. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶ 17). In addition, the Motion states that in exchange, MF08 would waive the right to pursue all MF08 Potential Avoidance Actions against REL Noteholders, and MF08 would be appointed to the trust oversight committee of the liquidating trust to be created under the REL Plan. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶3 (summarizing terms of agreement resolving objection to MF08’s Proof of Claim and the relative treatment of all unsecured claims and the REL Noteholder claims)).\nThe Motion explained that absent this agreement, the parties would be forced to litigate the merits of the MF08 Proof of Claim, the merits of the final plan compromise, the relative priorities and rights as between the holders of general unsecured claims and the REL Noteholders, and the merits of the MF08 Potential Avoidance Actions. This was an unattractive proposition because it would “consume substantial cash that would otherwise be distributable to REL Noteholders and MF08’s creditors.” Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶ 23-25).\nThe Motion also noted that many REL Noteholders were also investors in MF08, and paying the professionals to redistribute the limited funds available as between MF08 and REL would reduce the total amount received by all creditors. Litigating MF08’s Potential Avoidance Actions would also likely be complex and could require expensive efforts to trace funds, and every dollar spent on professionals would reduce the amount available for distribution to creditors. The modified plan eliminated these issues and was supported by all stakeholders, including the committee of MF08’s noteholders. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶ 23-25).\nOn June 18, 2012, the REL bankruptcy court held a hearing on the Motion and granted it. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 11 (Order on Motion). As a result, MF08 obtained allowance of its $66 million claim, the $5 million preferred payment, and a position on the REL trust oversight eom-mittee. The REL Noteholders agreed to reduce the allowed amount of their claims by 50% of what they had been paid between the November 2007 Exchange Transaction and REL’s September 2011 petition date in exchange for a release from potential fraudulent transfer actions. With the REL Noteholders’ and MF08’s support, REL obtained a clear path to confirmation of its Plan.\nE. The Settlement Agreement\nThe Settlement Agreement is an exhibit to the Motion. Of particular concern for these summary judgment motions are the following sections. The recitals in § 2 of the Settlement Agreement provide:\n2.01 MF08 transferred cash in an amount equal to $66,226,496 to [REL] during the period from December of 2007 and through 2008.\n2.02 MF08 contends that [REL] is liable to MF08 for the monies received on various theories, including without limitation based upon the contention that the transfers may have constituted fraudulent transfers.\n2.03 During the time period from December of 2007 through approximately August of 2008, [REL] received cash and deposited that cash into its general account from multiple sources, including without limitation (a) the transfers from MF08 described in 2.01, above, (b) payoffs by [REL’s] borrowers of principal and interest, (c) sales of assets, and (d) advances by Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC (‘Wells Fargo”).\n2.04 During the time period from December of 2007 through approximately August of 2008, [REL] made payments out of its general account to many different parties, including without limitation, payments to various creditors, including without limitation the holders of Exchange Notes issued to [REL’s] Note-holders (the “REL Transfers”).\n2.05 MF08 contends that if it could trace the funds that it transferred to [REL] as described in Paragraph 2.01 from [REL] to the holders of Exchange Notes, MF08 might have the right to pursue recovery from the holders of Exchange Notes as “subsequent transferees” pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 550(d) [sic], [REL] contends that holders of Exchange Notes who received the REL Transfers cannot be liable to MF08 because (a) it is not possible to trace the dollars received from MF08 to any specific REL Transfer; and (b) each holder of an Exchange Note that received an REL Transfer, with the possible exception of insiders who may have received an REL Transfer, received any such REL Transfer on account of a debt payable by [REL] for value, in good faith, and without knowledge of the void-ability of the transfer from MF08 to [REL] (even assuming the transfer is avoidable) and, therefore, would be shielded from liability pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 550(b).\n2.06 MF08’s potential right to assert claims against holders of Exchange Notes that received REL Transfers shall be referred to herein as “MF08’s Potential Avoidance Actions”.\nSections 3.01—3.03 dealt with the allowance of MF08’s claim in the REL case. In short, if REL’s Plan was confirmed and the plan compromise was\' approved, MF08’s Proof of Claim “shall be allowed” in the amount of $66,226,496. Sections 4.01 — 4.02 dealt with waiver of the right to pursue MF08 Potential Avoidance Actions:\n4.01 If the MF08 Claim is Allowed pursuant to Paragraph 3 above,’ MF08 waives the right to pursue any MF08 Potential Avoidance Actions; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not limit or restrict the right of MF08 to bring any action against any third party, including any manager, member, insider or professional of MF08. This provision shall be void and of no further force or effect if the MF08 Claim is not Allowed pursuant to Paragraph 3, above.\n4.02 With respect to the claims released herein, MF08 acknowledges that it has been advised by its attorneys concerning, and is familiar with, the California Civil Code Section 1542 and it expressly waives any and all rights under California Civil Code Section 1542 and under any other federal or state statute or law of similar effect with respect to the claims released herein. Section 1542 of the California Civil Code provides as follows:\nA GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.\nDocket no. 48, RJN Ex. 9-10 (Motion and Settlement Agreement) (emphasis in original).\nF. The Transfer to Montgomery\nThe Trustee declares that shortly after she was appointed as Trustee in February 2012, she was provided all the books and records maintained by MF08, including the bank statements and general ledgers for both MF08 and TMF. Docket no. 44-5, Uecker Dec. ¶ 3.\nBetween approximately July 22, 2008 and October 8, 2008, the managers of REL made a series of transfers from MF08 to TMF and these funds were used to pay REL investors to keep the REL “Ponzi scheme” going. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 16-17. The transfer to Montgomery is allegedly one of these transfers. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 18. The FAC alleges that MF08 was insolvent at the time these transfers were made and they were made with actual or constructively fraudulent intent and no value was given in exchange. Docket no. 30, FAC ¶ 17-21. (The Trustee’s expert also states that MF08 was insolvent from its inception onwards. Docket no. 44-7, Sugarman Dec. ¶ 11. Montgomery .does not dispute that MF08 was insolvent.)\nMontgomery had $924,887 invested in REL as of December 31, 2007. Docket no. 46-2, Montgomery Dec. ¶ 4, Ex. 1, Ex. 5. On July 1, 2008, at Montgomery’s request, REL transferred $150,000 to Montgomery. On July 31, 2008, an additional- $150,000 was transferred to Montgomery. These transfers went directly to Montgomery’s Individual Retirement Account at Wells Fargo Bank. Docket no. 31, Answer Ex. B (9/30/08 REL investor portfolio account statement—each $150,000 transfer described as “sold shares” in REL); Docket no. 46-2, Montgomery Dec. Ex. 1 (3/18/10 REL investor portfolio account statement—each transfer described as “note prepay”); Docket no. 46-2, Montgomery Dec. Ex. 3.(1/1/08-12/31/08 Wells Fargo Bank IRA statement — each transfer described as “liquidation RE Loans”). The Trustee seeks to recover this second $150,000 transfer because it was made by a check written on TMF’s bank account.\nIn support of her motion, the Trustee offers the July 2008 bank statements for MF08 and TMF. Docket no. 44-5, Uecker Dec. Ex. 1-2. In support of his motion and in opposition to the Trustee’s, Montgomery offers REL’s -July 2008 bank statement. Docket no. 48, RJN, Ex. 12.\nThe bank documents offered by both the Trustee and Montgomery show the following sequence of events:\n1. On July 21, 2008, REL transferred $528,791 to MF08. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 12 at 2 of 6 (REL bank statement); Docket no. 44-6, Uecker Dec. Ex. 1 at 1 of 3 (MF08 bank statement).\n2. On July 21, 2008, MF08 transferred $528,791 to TMF. Docket no. 44-6, Uecker Dec. Ex. 1 at 2 of 3 (MF08 bank statement), Ex. 2 at 1 of 2 (TMF bank statement).\n3. On July 23, 2008, TMF wrote check no. 1020 for $150,000 made payable to ‘WFB IRA Services fbo Montgomery.” Docket no. 44-6, Uecker Dec. Ex. 3 ($150,-000 check).\n4. On July 25, 2008, REL transferred $447,566 to MF08. Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 12 at 5 of 6 (REL bank statement), Docket no. 44-6, Uecker Dec. Ex. 1 at 2 of 3 (MF08 bank statement).\n5. On July 28, 2008, MF08 transferred $447,566 to TMF. Docket no. 44-6, Uecker Dec. Ex. 1 at 2 of 3 (MF08 bank statement) Ex. 2 at 1 of 2 (TMF bank statement).\n6. On July 28, 2008, TMF’s bank honored the $150,000 check to Montgomery. Docket no. 44-6, Uecker Dec. Ex. 2 at 2 of 2 (TMF bank statement). Montgomery’s IRA statement shows it had received this $150,000 as of July 31, 2008. Docket no. 46-2, Montgomery Dec. Ex. 3.\nThe Trustee points out that the only deposit into the TMF account between July 1 and July 23, 2008 was the $528,791 deposit and it raised the balance in this account to $571,022. However, the July 2008 TMF bank statement also shows that $447,566 was deposited on July 28, 2008. The TMF bank statement also shows there were only two withdrawals from the TMF account between July 21 and July 28 — the $150,000 check to Montgomery and a $400,000 wire transfer to another REL Noteholder who has settled his fraudulent transfer case brought by the Trustee.\nThe Trustee says MF08’s books and records do not show that MF08’s transfer \'of $528,791 to TMF was in payment of a debt owed by MF08 to TMF and do not show that MF08 received anything from TMF in exchange for this transfer. She also states that TMF’s records do not reflect that the transfer was in payment of a debt owed by MF08 to TMF or that TMF transferred any assets or property to MF08 in exchange for the funds. Docket no. 44-5, Uecker Dec. ¶ 9. Montgomery does not challenge this.\nIt is undisputed that in July 2008, REL transferred $528,791 to MF08 and then transferred $447,566 to MF08 and MF08 immediately transferred these exact amounts to TMF. It is also undisputed that when sufficient funds were in the TMF account, TMF’s bank honored the check to Montgomery and it was credited to his IRA on July 31, 2008.\nThe Trustee states that the $66 million in the Proof of Claim does not include the amounts that MF08 transferred to TMF which were then used to pay REL Note-holders such as Montgomery. Docket no. 44-5, Uecker Dec. ¶ 13-14. The only support for this assertion is the Trustee’s own statement. The time period for the Cash Transfers includes the date of the transfer to Montgomery. At a minimum, and without more support, this suggests that some of the funds transferred from MF08 to REL may eventually have made their way to him and this $150,000 transfer may be included in the total in the Proof of Claim.\nIII. Discussion\nA. Summary Judgment Standard\nA court should grant summary judgment if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), applicable here by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7056. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Material facts are those that may affect the outcome of the case. Anderson, at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505. A dispute about a material fact is genuine if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the non-moving party. Id. at 248-49, 106 S.Ct. 2505.\nA party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for the motion and identifying those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions or affidavits that demonstrate the absence of a triable issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). To meet its burden, the moving party must either produce evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving party’s claim or defense or show that the nonmoving party does not have enough evidence of an essential element to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial. Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. Ltd. v. Fritz Companies, Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir.2000).\nIf the moving party meets its initial burden, the burden shifts to the non-moving party, which must go beyond the pleadings and submit admissible evidence supporting its claims or defenses and showing a genuine issue for trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548; Nissan Fire, 210 F.3d at 1103. If the non-moving party does not produce evidence to show a genuine issue of material fact, the moving party is entitled to summary judgment. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548.\nIn ruling on a motion for summary judgment, inferences drawn from the underlying facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986).\nMontgomery has the burden of proving he is entitled to summary judgment on his affirmative defenses regarding the Settlement Agreement. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A court may grant summary judgment regarding the interpretation of ambiguous language in a contract if the non-moving party fails to point to any relevant extrinsic evidence supporting that party’s interpretation of the language. Compagnie Financiere de CIC et de L’Union Europeenne v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 232 F.3d 153 (2nd Cir.2000).\nThe Trustee has the burden of proof on the elements of her fraudulent transfer claim. To avoid summary judgment in her favor, Montgomery must identify specific triable facts. Southern California Gas Co. v. City of Santa Ana, 336 F.3d 885 (9th Cir.2003).\nB. The Trustee’s Summary Judgment Argument\nThe Trustee argues that she has shown that MF08 is entitled to summary judgment on its Civil Code § 3439.04(a)(2)(A) constructive fraudulent transfer claim (applicable here pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 544(b)).\nShe asserts that the undisputed facts show MF08 is entitled to avoid the transfer of $528,791 from MF08 to TMF and may recover $150,000 of it from Montgomery as either the initial transferee or the immediate transferee of the initial transferee as Bankruptcy Code § 550(a) permits. Docket no. 44, Memorandum at 10-11. She acknowledges that TMF may not have had dominion over the funds because TMF, MF08, and REL were all controlled by Walter and Kelly Ng which would make Montgomery the initial transferee rather than a subsequent transferee. However, she claims this does not change the outcome.\nThe Trustee also argues that she has shown she is entitled to summary judgment disposing of Montgomery’s affirmative defense under Bankruptcy Code § 550(b) because there is no evidence that he gave value to TMF or MF08 and his interpretation of the Settlement Agreement is simply incorrect. Docket no. 44, Memorandum at 12-17.\nIn opposition to the Trustee’s motion, Montgomery argues that he is, in fact, the recipient of a REL Transfer based on the series of transfers that ended with the TMF check to his IRA. Under that theory, he argues that the Settlement Agreement covers this transfer to him. He also contends that MF08’s waiver of the protections of Civil Code § 1542 in the Settlement Agreement also protects him. Relying on In re California Litjunding, 360 B.R. 310 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.2007), Montgomery also contends that the Trustee’s lawsuit is an impermissible collateral attack on the REL Confirmation Order. Docket no. 54, Memorandum.\nIn reply, the Trustee argues that Montgomery has not offered any evidence to defeat entry of summary judgment on her fraudulent transfer case. He has presented no evidence showing that MF08 did not have dominion over the funds that may have been transferred to it by REL. Whether REL was the source of the funds does not matter because there is no evidence that MF08’s right to use the funds was restricted in any way. Adams v. Anderson (In re Superior Stamp & Coin Co.), 223 F.3d 1004, 1009 (9th Cir.2000) (discussing earmarking doctrine for preference analysis, where bank advanced funds to debtor on condition they be used for paying a specific creditor, debtor did not have control over the funds, earmarking defense applied). As to the release issue, she argues that Montgomery ignores the plain language of the Settlement Agreement and offers no evidence on which the trier of fact could find that the Settlement Agreement was intended to release this claim. Docket no. 60, Reply Memorandum.\nC.Montgomery’s Summary Judgment Argument\nMontgomery moves for summary judgment on his affirmative defenses. He makes the same arguments made in opposition to the Trustee’s motion, i.e., that the Settlement Agreement covers this claim against him, that he is a good faith transferee for value, and that the evidence shows he was in fact the recipient of a REL Transfer. Docket no. 49, Memorandum.\nIn opposition to Montgomery’s motion, the Trustee argues Montgomery has offered no evidence to defeat her entitlement to summary judgment on her fraudulent transfer case and repeats the arguments about the interpretation of the Settlement Agreement. Docket\' no. 52, Opposition Memorandum.\nIn reply, Montgomery argues it defies credulity for the Trustee to argue she was unaware of the transfers from MF08 to TMF because she had all relevant records at the time she signed the Settlement Agreement. The waiver of the protections of Civil Code § 1542 prevent her from suing him. Docket no. 61, Reply Memorandum.\nD.Discussion of the Release Issues\nThe essential question raised by Montgomery’s motion for summary judgment on his affirmative defense regarding the Settlement Agreement is whether the Settlement Agreement between REL and MF08 released this fraudulent transfer claim against him. Was he released as a subsequent transferee because he was paid by REL using untraceable MF08 money, or was he excluded from this released class because he was paid by TMF, MF08’s owner and manager, with funds traceable to, or originating with and under the dominion of, MF08? Was Montgomery released because MF08 waived the right to pursue unknown or unsuspected claims that it had at the time the Settlement Agreement was signed? Or is he a third party the Trustee reserved the right to sue?\nThe Trustee argues that the Settlement Agreement released only a narrow class of claims\'—claims against REL Noteholders who were paid by REL—and § 4.01 preserves MF08’s right to bring this action against Montgomery as “any third party.” The Trustee also insists that the language of the Settlement Agreement does not support a finding that the intent of the parties was to release unknown claims. Docket no. 44, Trustee’s Memorandum at 17. On the other hand, Montgomery argues that the language of the Settlement Agreement clearly supports his position that the intent was to release this action against him. He relies on the language in the Settlement Agreement, and on the communications he received from the Noteholders Committee urging a vote in favor of the REL Plan. Docket no. 54, Montgomery’s Memorandum at 9; Docket no. 46-2, Montgomery Dec. Ex. 8 (Committee’s letter explaining REL Plan). Thus, they clearly disagree as to the Settlement Agreement’s meaning, suggesting, at the very least, that it may be ambiguous.\n1. Is the Settlement Agreement Ambiguous?\nIf the Settlement Agreement is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous. Winet v. Price, 4 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1165-66, 6 Cal. Rptr.2d 554 (1992). To determine whether it is ambiguous, the court provisionally accepts extrinsic evidence regarding competing interpretations of the Agreement. Pacific Gas & E. Co. v. G.W. Thomas Drayage & etc. Co., 69 Cal.2d 33, 39-40, 69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641 (1968) (rational interpretation requires at least a preliminary consideration of all credible evidence offered to prove the intention of the parties).\nMontgomery requests that the court take judicial notice of certain documents that are, in context, extrinsic evidence. As explained in Winet v. Price ;\nThe decision to admit\' parol evidence involves a two-step process. First, the court provisionally receives (without actually admitting) all credible evidence concerning the .parties’ intentions to determine “ambiguity,” i.e., whether the language is “reasonably susceptible” to the interpretation urged by.a party.\' If in light of the.extrinsic evidence the court decides the language is “reasonably susceptible” to the interpretation urged, the extrinsic evidence is then admitted to aid in the second step-interpreting the contract.\nWinet v. Price, 4 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1166, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554 (1992).\nThis threshold question regarding\' ambiguity is answered in the affirmative by a review of the language of the Settlement Agreement, a review of the extrinsic evidence offered by Montgomery, and the language of the Proof of Claim itself.\nReferring to the defined terms in § 2.01-2.05 of the Settlement Agreement, the Trustee argues that MF08 released only its claims against REL Noteholders for recovery of amounts paid by REL and these are the MF08 Potential Avoidance Actions MF08 agreed to release. The Trustee also contends that the language in § 4.01 reserving the right to pursue “any action against any third party, including any manager, member, insider or professional of MF08” means that she may pursue Montgomery as he is “any third party.” She claims no extrinsic evidence is required to see the intent of the parties and none has been provided by Montgomery contradicting her interpretation.\nReferring to the undisputed fact that individuals Walter and Kelly Ng owned, controlled and managed REL, MF08 and TMF, Montgomery argues that the paid by REL terminology is a meaningless distinction in the context in which this settlement was reached and the release was intended to cover this transfer to him. He offers in support: (1) his REL investor portfolio account statement in which REL takes credit for the $150,000 payment TMF ostensibly made to him; (2) the REL Noteholders’ Committee’s letter to the REL Noteholders; (3) the findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of the REL Confirmation Order; and (4) his Wells Fargo Bank IRA statement indicating payments had come from REL. In addition, the court notes that language in MF08’s Proof of Claim shows that MF08 was aware that TMF was used to make the allegedly fraudulent transfers at the behest of the Ngs who controlled all of the related entities. Docket no. 44-5, Uecker Dec., Ex. 5, (Proof of Claim ¶ 3 (the “Ngs caused the transfer” of $66 million, the transfers were made “either directly to REL, indirectly through TMF or Bar-K, or [directly] to REL’s borrowers”)).\nThe court has provisionally admitted this evidence and reviewed it. The court concludes that the language of the Settlement Agreement is reasonably susceptible to the competing interpretations offered by the parties and it is therefore ambiguous.\n2. The Extrinsic Evidence\nHaving found that the Settlement Agreement is ambiguous, the court can admit all credible extrinsic evidence to construe it. Pacific Gas & E. Co. v. G.W. Thomas Drayage etc. Co., 69 Cal.2d 33, 37, 69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641 (1968). Such evidence includes the circumstances surrounding the making of the Agreement, including its object, nature, and subject matter. The court takes judicial notice of the extrinsic evidence requested by Montgomery.\nIf the extrinsic evidence is not in conflict, the resolution of the ambiguity is a question of law. Wolf v. Superior Court, 114 Cal.App.4th 1343, 1351, 8 Cal.Rptr.3d 649 (2004); Scheenstra v. California Dairies, Inc., 213 Cal.App.4th 370, 390, 153 Cal.Rptr.3d 21 (2013) (even where uncontroverted evidence allows for conflicting inferences to be drawn, interpretation of contract solely a judicial function). Here, the extrinsic evidence is not in conflict.\n3. Interpretation of the Settlement Agreement\nSection 8.07 of the Settlement Agreement provides that it is to be governed by California law. Under California law, the court interprets the Settlement Agreement using the same principles applicable to the interpretation of any other contract. The goal is to interpret it to give effect to the mutual intent of the parties as it existed when they contracted. Civil Code § 1636 (contract must be interpreted to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting, so far as the same is ascertainable and lawful), Pacific Gas & E. Co., 69 Cal.2d at 38, 69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641. It is the outward expression of the agreement, rather than a party’s unexpressed intention, which the court will enforce. Winet, 4 Cal.App.4th at 1165, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554.\nA release is the abandonment, relinquishment or giving up of a right or claim to the person against whom it might have been demanded or enforced. Civil Code § 1541 (an obligation is extinguished by a release therefrom given to the debtor by the creditor); Marder v. Lopez, 450 F.3d 445 (9th Cir.2006). In general, a written release extinguishes any obligation covered by the release’s terms, provided it has not been obtained by fraud, deception, misrepresentation, duress, or undue influence. Marder, 450 F.3d at 449.\n4. “REL Transfer” and “Paid by REL”\nThe Trustee argues that the Settlement Agreement defines a narrow category of claims in §§ 2.04-2.06 which were released: the MF08 Potential Avoidance Actions against REL Noteholders who were paid by REL with the $66 million transferred from MF08. It is undisputed that the check Montgomery received was written by TMF from its bank account. Based on this fact alone, the Trustee claims Montgomery was not paid by REL so he is not among the class of REL Noteholders covered by the release in the Settlement Agreement.\nMontgomery’s interpretation of “REL Transfer” and “paid by REL”. in the Settlement Agreement relies, in part, on his extrinsic evidence regarding the context in which the Settlement Agreement was reached.\nThe extrinsic evidence is consistent on one essential point. By everything he was told by REL, it is reasonable to interpret the Settlement Agreement as Montgomery does. By all appearances, he had been paid by REL and had received a REL Transfer: (1) he was paid in the time period described in the Proof of Claim (i.e., December 2007-February 2009), and in the time period in § 2.04 of the Settlement Agreement (i.e., December 2007-August 2008); and (2) his investor portfolio account statement showed REL took credit for making the $150,000 payment when it was made.\nThe REL Noteholders’ Committee’s communications to Montgomery and the other REL Noteholders were consistent with the documentation Montgomery had received from REL before any controversy arose. REL Docket no. 832 (Notehold-ers’ Committee’s proposed solicitation let- • ter); Docket no. 46-2, Montgomery Dec. Ex. 8 (final version of solicitation letter: “In addition, MF08 will release any claims it could otherwise assert against Notehold-ers that received transfers from REL (other than insiders)”).\nFinally, it is undisputed that the Ngs controlled MF08, TMF, and REL and had a pattern of treating them as they wished as the MF08 Proof of Claim stated — the Ngs caused the $66 million in transfers to be made, either directly or indirectly. Based on this, the court concludes that Montgomery’s interpretation of the phrases “REL Transfer” and “paid by REL” is reasonable and the Trustee’s is erroneous.\n5. “Any Third Party”\nUnder § 4.01 of the Settlement Agreement, MF08 waived the right to pursue any MF08 Potential Avoidance Actions “provided, however, that this agreement shall not limit or restrict the right of MF08 to bring any action against any third party, including any manager, member, insider or professional of MF08.” The Trustee argues that this savings clause in § 4.01 preserves all claims other than those against REL Noteholders who were “paid by REL.”\nFor several reasons, the Trustee’s interpretation of this savings clause is erroneous. First, read literally, the reservation of the right to pursue “any third party” would arguably mean no one was released. That absurd reading is to be avoided. Civil Code § 1688.\nSecond, the undisputed objective of the Settlement Agreement was (1) to resolve the issues regarding the validity and priority of MF08’s claim which was based on the alleged fraudulent transfer of $66 million to REL where tracing was problematic and the Ngs’ commingling was endemic; (2) to eliminate the REL Noteholders’ risk of being sued by both MF08 and REL as the alleged recipients of fraudulent transfers in order to ensure their support for REL’s Plan; and (3) to eliminate MF08’s ability to impede confirmation because MF08’s $66 million claim made it the largest unsecured creditor in REL’s case.\nBased on the context in which the Settlement Agreement arose, the court declines to adopt the Trustee’s interpretation that an avoidance action against “any third party” includes a REL Noteholder who was paid by MF08 or TMF. If there was an intent to carve this group of REL Note-holders out of the release, it had to be precisely stated before the settlement was incorporated into REL’s Plan. MF08 acknowledged from the start that the “Ngs caused” every payment by any of these affiliated entities to be made in a way that suited their designs and the record shows the Trustee was in possession of records that would have enabled her to trace this transfer before she signed the Settlement Agreement. To pretend otherwise endorses a fiction — that MF08 had legitimate independent management.\nThe settlement between REL and MF08, with the full participation of the REL Noteholders’ Committee, was negotiated in order to “buy peace” with all the stakeholders so REL could reach a consensual confirmation of its Plan. As it was described in the Motion, “the principal parties in interest in the Debtors’ chapter 11 cases have reached the Agreement which resolves both potential disputes regarding MF08’s proof of claim ... and the relative treatment of all unsecured claims and Noteholder claims under the Modified Plan.” Docket no. 48, RJN Ex. 10 (Motion ¶ 8) (emphasis added). The Trustee obtained the $5 million “enhancement” and the REL Noteholders agreed to reduce their claims by 50% of what they had been paid on their REL investments pre-petition. The REL Noteholders were led to believe their risk of being sued — by MF08 and REL — as the recipients of allegedly fraudulent transfers was eliminated.\nIn addition, the drafting of § 4.01 is troubling. The words “include” and “including” are not limiting. Because “including” does not place a limit on “any third party” why follow “any third party” with the narrow list of “any manager, member, insider, or professional of MF08”? See In re Coudert Bros., 487 B.R. 375, 390 (S.D.N.Y.2013) (interpreting employment agreement, “may include” by itself is not a limiting clause but it does not exist in isolation; the following phrasfe “and whatever other action ...” is one of limitation).\nThere are several contract interpretation tools that support finding that the Trustee’s interpretation of “any third party” is erroneous. For example, under the principle ejusdem generis (literally, of the same kind), where specific words follow general words in a contract, the general words are construed to embrace only things similar in nature to those enumerated by the specific words. California Farm Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd., 143 Cal. App.4th 173, 189, 49 Cal.Rptr.3d 169 (2006) (where specific words follow general words, the general words are construed to embrace only things similar to the enumerated specific words), Nygard, Inc. v. Uusi-Kerttula, 159 Cal.App.4th 1027, 1045, 72 Cal.Rptr.3d 210 (2008) (“any information” construed in light of the kinds of protected information enumerated in the next sentence). Applying that principle here indicates that the specific class — managers, members, insiders or professionals of MF08 — defines the broad class — third parties. REL Noteholders are not in the class of intended third parties.\nThe rule of interpretation noscitur a sociis (literally, it is known from its associates) suggests that where “any third party” is ambiguous, its meaning may be discerned from the list that follows it, i.e., here it means only third parties who were managers, members, insiders or professionals of MF08. California Farm Bureau Federation, at 189, 49 Cal.Rptr.3d 169.\nThe rule of interpretation ex-pressio unius est exclusio alterius means the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of the other. Rosenthal-Zuckerman v. Epstein, Becker & Green Long Term Disability Plan, 39 F.Supp.3d 1103, 1107 (C.D.Cal.2014). Application of this concept suggests that the list following “any third party” illustrates the type of third party — managers, members, insiders or professionals of MF08. REL Notehold-ers are not within this type of third party.\nThese interpretive rules assist the court in discerning the meaning of “any action against any third party” in § 4.01. Based on these rules and the context for the settlement, the court concludes that the Trustee’s interpretation of the phrase “any action against any third party, including any manager, member, insider or professional of MF08” is incorrect. As a REL Noteholder, Montgomery is not the type of third party the Trustee may sue.\n6. Waiver of the Right to Pursue Unknown Claims\nCivil Code § 1542 provides that a general release does not extend to claims that are unknown or unsuspected at the time the release is executed. Because MF08 waived the protection of Civil Code § 1542, the release in the Settlement Agreement does apply to claims that were unknown or unsuspected at the time she signed the Settlement Agreement.\nThe Trustee argues that MF08 waived the protections of Civil Code § 1542 only “with respect to the claims released herein” and the “claims released herein” are only the claims against REL Noteholders who were paid by REL. As discussed above, the court finds that this distinction between “paid by REL” and “paid by TMF” does not hold up.\nBut the Trustee’s argument regarding Civil Code § 1542 bears further discussion. The Trustee says she possessed all the relevant books and records, but at the time she signed the Settlement Agreement, she was “not aware that funds had been transferred from MF08 to TMF and then used to pay REL Noteholders” because she and her counsel were “focused on maximizing the value of MF08’s claim and on the preservation and liquidation of MF08’s loan portfolio.” Docket no. 54-5, Uecker Dec. ¶ 8, ¶ 16-17. This is troubling in itself as it was her duty to be fully informed during the settlement negotiations and she possessed the records that allowed her to be fully informed. If she was aware of these transfers but did not disclose them, it gives the appearance that she may not have been fully candid with the other participants in the mediation. At a minimum, prudence would suggest that the waiver of the protections of Civil Code § 1542 should have been more carefully considered than it seems to have been, more carefully drafted than it was, or omitted altogether.\nThe Trustee concedes that there is what she calls a “boilerplate” waiver of Civil Code § 1542’s protections but contends the § 1542 waiver does not operate to release this claim because “there is no language in the release purporting to release unknown claims and Montgomery did not introduce any evidence that the parties’ intent was to release unknown claims,” and there is “no language in the REL Settlement Agreement releasing claims that the Trustee did not know or suspect to exist” or language by which “the parties took the risk that unknown or unanticipated claims might exist.” Docket no. 52, Opposition Memorandum at 7. She insists that what she calls the “mere recital” of the § 1542 waiver is not sufficient.\nThe Trustee is wrong for several reasons. First, the language in the Settlement Agreement is more than a “mere recital” of a Civil Code § 1542 waiver. The Settlement Agreement clearly acknowledges that (1) her counsel had given her advice about the significance of waiving § 1542, and (2) she was independently aware of the significance of waiving its protections for both unknown or unsuspected claims.\nSecond, in every place she makes this argument about the necessity of “independent language,” the Trustee quotes one isolated sentence from Casey v. Proctor, 59 Cal.2d 97, 109, 28 Cal.Rptr. 307, 378 P.2d 579 (1963):\nIt therefore appears beyond reasonable doubt that Civil Code section 1542 was intended by its drafters to preclude the application of a release to unknown claims in the absence of a showing apart from the words of the release of an intent to include such claims.\nId. at 109, 28 Cal.Rptr. 307, 378 P.2d 579.\nIn Casey, plaintiff was involved in a car accident and quickly afterwards signed a release covering property damage (for which he was paid) and bodily injuries (for which he was not paid); the release did not include a waiver of Civil Code § 1542. When plaintiff later began to suffer-injuries stemming from the accident, he sued to recover compensation for these injuries. Defendant moved for and was given a directed verdict based on the release. The directed verdict was reversed on appeal. When the release was signed, neither party had reason to believe personal injuries had been suffered. Plaintiff argued that the release was a general release which, by operation of § 1542, did not extend to these unknown injuries. Defendant argued that it was a specific, not a general release, because it referred to unknown claims so plaintiff had released the personal injury claim. The court explained that § 1542 was not intended to prevent settlements of unknown claims:\nIts purpose was to prevent the mere recital in the release to that effect from barring a claim for injuries later discovered in the absence of a showing of a conscious understanding that if injuries were suffered which had not yet manifested themselves they too would be discharged by the release.\nId. at 109, 28 Cal.Rptr. 307, 378 P.2d 579.\nCasey is not helpful to the Trustee for several reasons. First, it is a personal injury case, a context with its own set of policy concerns lacking here. Brae Transp. Inc. v. Coopers & Lybrand, 790 F.2d 1439, 1445 (9th Cir.1986) (declining to apply rationale of personal injury cases to commercial case). Second, as explained in Winet v. Price, 4 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1171, n.7, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554 (1992):\nTo the extent Casey holds we must ignore the language of the release and examine only extrinsic evidence in evaluating the parties intent, Casey would be inconsistent with the Pacific Gas & E. Co. admonition that the contractual language is the source of the parties’ rights and duties, and that extrinsic evidence is examined only to construe any ambiguities extant in the language.\nId. at 1174, n. 7, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554.\nThird, the Settlement Agreement does indicate a conscious understanding that there may be other claims. The settlement was in significant part predicated on the difficulty and expense of tracing the transfers made by the Ng family members by and among their wholly owned entities. The presence of this tracing issue itself indicates a conscious understanding— apart from the words of the release in § 4.01 — that there was a risk that unknown or unsuspected claims might exist.\nFinally, the Trustee- argues that the § 1542 waiver is limited to “the claims released herein” — by which she means the REL Transfers and the MF08 Potential Avoidance Actions but nothing else. She is correct that a § 1542 waiver may be limited to specific- claims or circumstances. See Butler v. Vons Companies, Inc., 140 Cal.App.4th 943, 45 Cal.Rptr.3d 151 (2006) (contract ambiguous as to whether employee only released labor grievance claims and not employment discrimination claims so that § 1542 waiver may not apply to discrimination claim); Asare v. Hartford Fire Inc. Co., 1 Cal.App.4th 856, 2 Cal. Rptr.2d 452 (1991) (release of workers compensation claim did not apply to discrimination claim); Integrated Global Concepts, Inc. v. J2 Global, Inc., 2014 WL 1230910 (N.D.Cal. March 21, 2014) (waiver of § 1542 was limited by language to specific claims predating the agreement).\nThe weakness in this argument is that the claim against Montgomery is the same type of avoidance claim that the Trustee released — the only difference is that his IRA received $150,000 from a bank account in the name of TMF, MF08’s only member and manager. Unlike the distinction in Butler, where the question was about a labor grievance claim and an employment discrimination claim, or the issue in Asare, where the question was about a workers compensation claim and an employment discrimination claim, the distinction between an an avoidance action against an REL Noteholder “paid by REL” and one “paid by TMF,” ostensibly acting on behalf of REL, is too thin to hold up. See Brae Transportation, Inc. v. Coopers & Lybrand, 790 F.2d 1439 (9th Cir. 1986) (release covered claims regarding net worth, release was general as to this “type of claim”).\nMost problematic for the Trustee is her misplaced reliance on Winet v. Price, 4 Cal.App.4th 1159, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554 (1992). In Winet, an attorney and his former client entered into an agreement releasing all claims against the attorney including unknown and unsuspected claims, and waiving the benefit of Civil Code § 1542. Years later the client sued the attorney. The trial court granted summary judgment for the attorney on the theory that the release covered all claims being asserted by the former client.\nThe appellate court agreed. First, the unambiguous language of the agreement released all claims, known or unknown. Second, the client’s proffered testimony— his uncommunicated subjective intent that he did not intend to release a later discovered claim — was parol evidence that was inadmissible because it contradicted the agreement and the agreement was not reasonably susceptible to the client’s interpretation. Third, the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the release suggested that the client did in fact intend to release unknown claims.\nThe court explained that the client’s evidence of his subjective intent was not admissible because it:\nseeks to prove that a release of unknown or unsuspected claims was not intended to include unknown or unsuspected claims. If an argument such as this were given currency, a release could never effectively encompass unknown claims. A releasor would simply argue that a release of unknown or unsuspected claims applied only to known or suspected claims, making it ineffective as to unknown or unsuspected claims.\nId. at 1167, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554 (emphasis in original).\nThis is precisely the problem with the Trustee’s argument regarding MF08’s waiver of the protections of Civil Code § 1542. She admits she possessed all the MF08 and TMF bank records at the time she negotiated the Settlement Agreement and then declares she was not aware of the transfer that went from MF08 to TMF to Montgomery. In effect, she says that she did not intend to waive this unknown or unsuspected claim because she did not know of it or suspect she had it. Because she apparently belatedly discovered that she could trace funds from MF08 to TMF to Montgomery, she claims she can escape the fact that she waived the right to pursue unknown claims. In the context of this case, especially where the inability to trace was one of the underlying predicates for the Settlement Agreement, she cannot escape the conclusion that MF08’s waiver the protection of Civil Code § 1542 prevents her from pursuing recovery from Montgomery.\nIV. Conclusion\nFor the reasons explained above, the court grants summary adjudication in favor of Montgomery. The Settlement Agreement is ambiguous and the extrinsic evidence shows that the release in the Settlement Agreement covers the Trustee’s claims in this adversary proceeding. The remaining issues are moot.\n. The REL Disclosure Statement explains that REL was the successor entity resulting from the merger of nine limited partnerships into a limited liability company. B-4 Partners was REL’s sole manager from 2002 to REL’s ch. 11 filing in 2011 and REL\'s sole member from November 2007. From 2009, Walter, Kelly, and Barney Ng were the members of B-4 Partners. Walter Ng was a manager of B-4 Partners until he resigned when his bankruptcy case was filed in May 2011. REL Docket no. 843, Disclosure Statement at 18.\n. The REL plan confirmation process was underway in April 2012; the first version of its plan and disclosure statement were filed February 1, 2012. REL Docket nos. 465-466.\n. The court notes that in the Proof of Claim, the time period for the transfer of $66 million is December 4, 2007 to February 4, 2009 — not August 2008. Also, § 2.01 of the Settlement Agreement says the $66 million was transferred from “December 2007 through 2008” and § 2.04 defines the REL Transfers as having been made ""between December 2007 through approximately August 2008.” The FAC says the time period for the transfer to Montgomery is July 22, 2008 to October 8, 2008. There is no explanation for these differing dates. It is unclear if there is any significance to these differences.\n. The REL Confirmation Order describes MF08 as REL’s largest unsecured creditor. REL Docket no. 967, REL Confirmation Order ¶ M.\n. According to the Trustee’s Third Quarter 2015 Operating Report, the MF08 estate has been paid $1,591 million by the REL estate as of April 2015. MF08 Docket no. 824 (Operating Report).\n. Upon MF08\'s filing in September 2011, the Ngs were removed and new management and their professionals ""thoroughly reviewed MF08’s books and records with a view to tracing all transfers of cash made by MF08 during the history of its existence.” MF08 Docket no. 101, Disclosure Statement at 5. The court assumes this analysis was shared with the Trustee upon her appointment in February 2012 and that she possessed this information at the time she participated in the mediation in April 2012.\n. In September 2013, the Trustee commenced 16 other adversary proceedings against REL Noteholders with the same basic allegations as made in this case. Eight of these are still pending.\n. There is no explanation for this varying terminology.\n. The Trustee has objected to the admission of the REL bank statement on the grounds it is hearsay. The Trustee is correct. However, the Trustee appears to waive this objection by responding that the payments shown on this bank statement are shown on MF08’s records as payments by REL of accrued interest to MF08. Docket no. 52-1, Uecker Dec. ¶ 7-8.\n. The Trustee contends that the transfers of $528,791 and $447,566 were for ""payment of accrued interest"" on two loans sold by REL to MF08 in April 2008 but with the sales made effective as of December 2007. Docket no. 52-1, Uecker Dec., ¶ 6-9. However, according to the Trustee’s expert, ""[a]s of March 2008, the borrowers on these loans had stopped paying interest and the loans were in default.” Docket no. 44-7, Sugarman Dec., ¶ 9-10. The T & J Saucepan loan was in default at the time of transfer\'to MF08; the Peachtree loan was delinquent 30 days as of June 30, 2008. Docket no. 44-10, Sugarman Report at 12-14. Thus, it is unclear if interest payments were in fact made by REL’s borrowers or if these payments were fictional.\n. At oral argument Trustee’s counsel stated there was a basis for the assertion but did not specify what it was.\n. She also argues she has shown she is entitled to summary judgment on a Civil Code § 3439.05 claim but there is no such claim pled in the FAC.\n. Civil Code § 3439.01(a)(asset means property of debtor) and (h) (property means anything that may be subject of ownership); Bankruptcy Code § 548(a)(1) (a trustee may avoid a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property); In re Bullion Reserve of North America, 922 F.2d 544, 548 (9th Cir.1991) (discussing requirement of dominion over money for transferee status); In re Incomnet, Inc., 463 F.3d 1064 (9th Cir.2006) (discussing definition of transferee).\n.Because her claim is based on Civil Code § 3439.04 and § 3439.07, the defenses under Civil Code § 3439.08 are also relevant. In re ITS Corporation (Decker v. Tramiel), 617 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir.2010).\n. The Trustee also objects to many of the so-called undisputed facts in Montgomery’s motion. Docket no. 52-3, Statement of Disputed Facts in Opposition. The Trustee is largely correct.\n. The Trustee argues that the court should ignore the REL Noteholders’ Committee’s letter because it is the uncommunicated subjective intent of the Committee which is irrelevant in this context. Docket no. 52, Opposition at 22. The letter, in substantially the same form, was approved by the REL court to be delivered to the REL Noteholders with the ballot for voting on the REL Plan. REL Docket no. 832 (proposed solicitation letter). It was obviously communicated to the REL Noteholders. The REL Noteholders’ Committee’s counsel’s task was to explain the consequences of voting for or against confirmation. It is of limited utility here and the court merely notes the inaccuracy of the Trustee’s characterization of it as “uncom-municated.”\n. The Trustee argues that Montgomery has no extrinsic evidence that the parties to the Settlement Agreement intended to release any REL Noteholder who was not ""paid by REL.” In any argument about the intent of the parties, Montgomery is at a distinct disadvantage. As a REL Noteholder, counsel to the REL Noteholders’ Committee represented him in the negotiations and he is an intended beneficiary of the settlement.\n. The Declaration of James A. Weissenborn in support of confirmation of the REL Plan is consistent with this interpretation. REL Docket no. 943, ¶ 39-53 (describing the settlements implemented by the REL Plan).\n. Montgomery appears to misunderstand the terms of this 50% reduction. As the Motion explained it, if the plan compromise was approved, the Noteholders’ claims ""would not be subordinated or challenged, but each Note-holder’s claim would be reduced by 50% of any cash received after the Exchange Transaction through the petition date” of REL. In theory, the allowed amount of Montgomery\'s claim was to be reduced by 50% of the $450,000 he appears to have been repaid.\n. See American Sur. Co. of N.Y. v. Marotta, 287 U.S. 513, 53 S.Ct. 260, 77 L.Ed. 466 (1933) (""include” is generally used as a word of extension or enlargement rather than one of limitation or enumeration); Fraser v. Bentel, 161 Cal.390, 119 P. 509 (1911)(""includes” is not ordinarily a word of limitation, but rather of enlargement); Bankruptcy Code § 102(3) (same).\n. A release may also be construed most strongly against the party who prepared it. Sime v. Malouf, 95 Cal.App.2d 82, 212 P.2d 946 (1949). There is nothing indicating which party prepared the Settlement Agreement. It may have been drafted by REL\'s counsel or by the Trustee’s counsel; counsel to the REL Noteholders Committee may have participated in the drafting.\n. She goes so far as to say there is a “Casey rule.” Docket no. 61, Reply Memorandum at 10. As discussed in Winet v. Price, the California Supreme Court\'s Pacific Gas & Electric decision shows Casey has questionable prece-dential value. Winet, 4 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1171 n. 7, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554 (1992). The notion that there is a “Casey rule” is a pointless embellishment that comes, very close to being a misleading suggestion regarding the current state of the law.', 'type': 'majority'}]"
